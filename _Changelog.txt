v1.0 - Petroglyph'd
=========================================================================================
There are MasterTextFiles_ENGLISH.dat updates in this update! Check "_MasterTEXT Changelog.txt" in the game directory to see!


==================
General
==================
*Fixed STAR WARS (: Episode IV - A New Hope)' credits music.
**"Credits_Ep3.MP3" was an incorrect version of "The Throne Room/End Title" from a botched release of STAR WARS' soundtrack. It's replaced with a correct version.


==================
Factions
==================
*Empire/Rebellion -- Fixing conditionals. Changing reference Death_Star (EaW) to Death_Star_II (FoC). Rebels & Empire will now use the proper advisor dialogue for when the DSII, Palpatine or Mon Mothma are in battle.
*Empire/Rebellion -- Fixed Lose-to-Underworld music referencing "Lose_To_Zann_1.MP3" instead of "UND_Lose_To_Zann.MP3."
*Empire/Rebellion -- Fixed "object spotted announcement" for Darth Vader. Was searching Darth_Vader (EaW) instead of Darth_Vader_Expansion (FoC).

*Empire -- Fixing faction super weapon value from Death_Star (EaW) to Death_Star_II (FoC).

*Rebellion -- Fixed combination conditionals. Since Luke Skywalker can't destroy the Death Star in FoC (he could in EaW!), that Death Star + LSkywalker conditional has been changed to DSII + Rogue Squadron (Wedge's X-Wing specifically, as Wedge alone destroys the Death Star II, none of the other squadron does).

*Underworld -- Removed references to non-existant "finale" movies for galactic conquest.
*Underworld -- Fixed "object spotted announcement" for Darth Vader. Game was searching Darth_Vader (EaW) instead of Darth_Vader_Expansion (FoC).


==================
Units (Land)
==================
*Darth Vader -- Fixed HeroClash.XML trying to find "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC) when dueling against Obi-Wan Kenobi.
**This was one of three duels which are broken. The other two will be looked at in the future.

*Urai Fen -- Fixed Fen's unit file trying to find "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" for his lightsaber-block ability.

*Vornskr -- "Fixed" good against reference for Darth Vader; was "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC). No real change is made as it seems, but having it be referenced properly is always nice.


==================
Units (Space)
==================
*Acclamator Cruiser -- Fixed the back-right turbolaser's damage type. Was normal laser damage, now it's turbolaser damage.

*Rouge Squadron -- Fixed good-against references from "Death_Star" (EaW) to "Death_Star_II" (FoC) for all squadrons/containers.

*Skipray BlastBoat -- Fixed squadron escort status; "is escort" is now "no" instead of "nos."


==================
Units (Galactic Conquest)
==================
*Grand Admiral Thrawn -- Removed dupliate "activation style" tag in the remove corruption ability.
*Grand Admiral Thrawn -- Fixed Thrawn's remove corruption ability sound from the Rebellion's to the Empire's.
*Grand Admiral Thrawn -- Fixed Thrawn's spawning sound. It'll now play his own designated spawn sound.
