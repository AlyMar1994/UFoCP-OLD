==================
General
==================
*Fixed STAR WARS credits music.
**"Credits_Ep3.MP3" was an incorrect version of "The Throne Room/End Title" from a release of STAR WARS (: Episode IV - A New Hope)'s soundtrack. It's replaced with a correct version.

*Empire/Rebellion -- Fixing conditionals: changing reference Death_Star (EaW) to Death_Star_II. Both teams will now use the proper advisor dialogue for when a hero (such as the Death Star II, Palpatine, Mon Mothma, or a combination of such) is in battle.
*Empire/Rebellion -- Fixed Lose-to-Underworld music referencing "Lose_To_Zann_1.MP3" instead of "UND_Lose_To_Zann.MP3."
*Empire/Rebellion -- Fixed "Object Spotted Announcement" for Darth Vader. Was searching Darth_Vader (EaW) instead of Darth_Vader_Expansion (FoC).

*Empire -- Fixing defined faction super weapon from Death_Star (EaW) to Death_Star_II (FoC).

*Rebellion -- Fixed conditionals referring to a combination: since Luke Skywalker can't destroy the Death Star in FoC (he could in EaW!) his conditional has been changed to Rogue Squadron (Wedge's X-Wing specifically, as Wedge alone destroys the Death Star II).

*Underworld -- Removed references to non-existant "finale" movies for galactic conquest.
*Underworld -- Fixed "Object Spotted Announcement" for Darth Vader. Was searching Darth_Vader (EaW) instead of Darth_Vader_Expansion (FoC).


==================
Units (Land)
==================
*Darth Vader -- Fixed HeroClash.XML trying to find "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC) when dueling against Obi-Wan Kenobi.
**This was one of three duels which are broken. The other two will be looked at in the future.


==================
Units (Space)
==================
*Acclamator Cruiser -- Fixed the back-right turbolaser's damage type. Was normal laser damage, now it's turbolaser damage.
*Rouge Squadron -- Fixed good-against references from "Death_Star" (EaW) to "Death_Star_II" (FoC) for all squadrons/containers.


==================
Units (Galactic Conquest)
==================
*Grand Admiral Thrawn -- Removed dupliate <Activation_Style> tag in the "Remove Corruption" ability.
*Grand Admiral Thrawn -- Fixed Thrawn's "Remove Corruption" ability sound from the Rebellion's to the Empire's.
*Grand Admiral Thrawn -- Fixed Thrawn's spawning sound. It'll now play his own designated spawn sound.
