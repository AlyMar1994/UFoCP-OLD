CHANGES
===========
-Text has been majorly overhauled since v1.9. See the MasterTEXT Changelog for details.


*AI
-Fixed AI not building the Death Star II, or Darth Vader. The game now classifies them as the ultimate and penultimate technology upgrades, respectively. The AI should prioritize Vader, first.
-Fixed AI trying to call invalid Darth Vader tag to remove corruption.
-Fixed AI trying to call invalid Thrawn tag to remove corruption.
-Modified the Death Star Game Object Plan to avoid Rogue Squadron instead of Luke Skywalker, as Luke cannot destroy the Death Star anymore. Also avoids IG-88, who can destroy the DS2 as well.
-Added all starbases from each of the three factions into the upgrade space station AI. They will now upgrade space stations, albeit slowly.
-Removed commented out units from BuildGroundForcesPlan.
-Fixed Death Star AI to choose the Death Star II when firing.
-Added checks in GalacticFreeStoreAI to search for Tyber Zann, and label him as the leader of the Underworld and apply freestore AI to him.
-Modified Rogue Squadron's AI plan to prioritize attacking the Death Star II.


*FACTIONS
-Rebels and Empire will now use the proper advisor dialogue for when the Death Star II, Palpatine or Mon Mothma are in battle.
-Fixing "faction super weapon" type from "Death_Star" (EaW) to "Death_Star_II" (FoC).
-The Rebel advisor will now properly comment when the "Super Weapon Killer" (Wedge) is in battle with the Death Star.
-Rebel orbital bombardment no longer can be done without ion-cannoned ships in-orbit (removed Alliance Assault Frigate/Nebulon-B from pre-reqs). The only ships capable are Home One, and the Mon Calamari Cruiser.
-Fixed Underworld generic infantry icon, with the generic Underworld infantry (Grenadiers).
-Fixed Underworld generic starfighter icon, with the StarViper.
-Fixed Hostile faction (hostile to all factions faction) not having the Hutts as an added enemy.
-Fixed Hutts faction not having the Black Sun Pirates as enemies, but was vice versa.


*SOUND
-Fixed Thrawn's remove corruption ability sound from the Rebels' to the Empire's.
-Fixed Thrawn's "complete" sound. It'll now play his own designated "complete" sound.
-Fixed "object spotted announcement" for Thrawn for all factions. Was searching for "Grand_Admiral_Thrawn" instead of "Admonitor_Star_Destroyer."
-Fixed "object spotted announcement" for Darth Vader for all factions. Was searching "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC).
-Fixed Lose-to-Underworld music referencing "Lose_To_Zann_1.MP3" instead of "UND_Lose_To_Zann.MP3."
-Fixed credits music.
-Removed Underworld VO that still imply Imperial use of the repulsorlift jammer, or that the Underworld destroys the jammer when owned as the Underworld is the only faction to build it.
-Fixed Underworld VO for use of Skirmish turbotowers. Changed from Rebel VO to Underworld VO.
-Skywalker still said EaW line "Red 5 here!" when selected in space. This no longer happens.
-Fixed generic "lose battle" music refrencing "Rebel_Lose_Tactical/Strategic_Event." It now references the "Underworld_" variant of that.
-Fixed unit callouts for Tyber Zann. Underworld VO would say (for land) "Tyber Zann has landed!" as his space callout. This callout overall has been removed (as Zann has no proper space unit callout).
-Normalized Underworld leader by removing all extra tags from the GameConstants file regarding Underworld leader (now soley "Tyber_Zann").


*UNITS (Land)
-Fixed HeroClash.XML trying to find "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC) when dueling against Obi-Wan Kenobi.
-Fixed skirmish definitions on what unit version of Vader is to be used. To repair dueling and other mechanics, land skirmish Vader uses the FoC tag (Darth_Vader_Executor), while space uses the vanilla EaW tag (Darth_Vader).
-Fixed skirmish Vader's land tooltip. The land Vader no longer has the special text about the Super Star Destroyer Executor.
-Fixed Fen's unit file trying to find "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" for his lightsaber-block ability.
-Fixed amount of shots fired per-burst. The animation showed extra shots/recoil from the barrels, when in reality nothing shoots (leaving the tank shooting 2 times-per-fire with extra recoil). The Canderous tank now fires three shots.
-Modified Colonel Veers' death clones with the "IMPOSING_PRESENCE" behavior (and presence range), so Rebel Infantry units now respond properly with their "celebrate" "presence induced animation."
-Added a hero insignia to differentiate Veers's AT-AT (he was the only Empire hero not to have one). Veers now has the Empire land ring when highlighted/selected/stagnant by default.
-Fixed Imperial Guards' "presence induced animations" (i.e. standing at attention) in-front of Darth Vader, by changing the "Darth_Vader" (EaW) tag with "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC).
-Fixed Rebel Infantry "presence induced animations" for General Veers (Empire hero AT-AT) by adding death clones to Rebel "celebrate" animations.
-Fixed Rebel PLEX "presence induced animations" for General Veers' dead AT-AT.
-Fixed Scout Trooper "presence induced animations" for "Darth_Vader_Expansion."
-Fixed Stormtrooper "presence induced animations" for "Darth_Vader_Expansion."
-Fixed inconsistient 'Sprint' ability modifiers.
-Fixed inconsistient tagging for the Phase II and III Dark Troopers; collision-type was set to "Large Vehicle" and "Infantry" simaltaneously. It is now soley "Infantry."
-Fixed R2's "hack turret" ability not working on Skirmish Underworld-owned turbolaser towers.
-Fixed Force Adept's attack sounds. When swinging a lightsaber, the Force Adepts will no longer make the generic infantry blaster fire sound.
-Fixed "block lightsaber" ability not being able to block the Campaign Force Adept's lightsaber attacks, even though Urai has a chance to deflect all other lightsaber-using hero's attacks.

-Almost all expansion units have undergone hard point overhauls, with consistient damage factors and hard point editing.
-Fixed up almost all Underworld-built piracy units having incorrect "good against"/"vulnerable to" modifiers.
-All hero ships have undergone a name redo. They all follow the "SHIP NAME - CAPTAIN" system that a portion of hero ships did.

-Fixed Acclamator's back-right turbolaser damage type. Used laser damage multipliers ("Damage_Acclamator"), now it's turbolaser damage ("Damage_Acclamator_TL").
-Fixing the SSD armor type. It's now properly seperated and should work.
-Fixed Kyle Katarn's space unit "Is_Escort" indicator being "np" instead of "no."
-Fixed squadron escort status for Skipray Blastboats; "Is Escort" is now "No" instead of "nos."

-Changed Luke's X-wing tooltip from "TEXT_UNIT_LUKE_XWING" to custom "TEXT_UNIT_LUKE_XWING_01," to remove the "(Red 5)" indicator from the name (Red Squadron doesn't exist anymore, nor did Skywalker go under that callsign post-Yavin).
-Fixed Luke getting attached to any random available ship when he has a usable space fighter.
-Made Skywalker's X-wing a variant of the original X-wing unit. This fixes multiple bugs: Luke's fighter not hyperspace jumping into battle, and the extended health bar.

-Fixed B-wing squadron's tags. "Is_Escort" was set to "Nos" instead of "No."
-Fixed B-wing trying to use only one ion weapon, twice. Instead of two references to "HP_BWING_ION_00," it's now "HP_BWING_ION_00" and "HP_BWING_ION_01" so both ion weapons fire.
-Fixed shot-laser color on B-wings from green to red. Muzzleflash was red, lasers were green.
-Fixed tooltip by fixing number of laser cannons in description. Now mentions the 4 laser cannons, instead of 2.
-Fixed IPV Patrol Craft having no selection UI ring when selected.
-Fixed IPV Patrol Craft using incorrectly assigned "power to weapons" ability sound (was Corellian Corvette, now IPV).
-Added the Underworld to the list of affiliated factions with the IPV Patrol Craft.

-Fixed Rebellion, Empire and Pirate V-wings to be affiliated/have correct build sounds per-faction.

-Fixed Tarrin Datch's fighter name in Rogue Squadron (was "Tarrub Datch")
-Fixed Grand Admiral Thrawn and Captain Piett's tooltips not being used properly. Both tooltips from each unit have been merged, as the game can only use the ship unit.
-Fixed all faction Z-95 Headhunters from bad affiliation tags.


*UNITS (GC)
-Fixed various units' remove corruption ability, by adding them to GameConstants.xml. All of these units had remove corruption AI and ability, but couldn't work due to not being logged in GameConstants (Admiral Ackbar, Han Solo & Chewbacca, Kyle Katarn & Mara Jade, Colonel Maximillian Veers).

-Fixed unit tooltip using R2-D2's instead of his own.
-Fixed C-3P0 not having a unit icon.
-Fixed R2-D2's unit using both 3P0's and R2's icon instead of using their individual icons.
-Fixed the unused Galactic-only unit of Grand Admiral Thrawn. Fixed the wrong unit being referenced in the team, and fixed the icon of the team.
-Fixed R2-D2 & C-3PO's Galactic tooltips not having units' original description, only the tooltip if the unit can capture build pads or not.
-Fixed Han Solo & Chewbacca's Galactic tooltips not indicating if unit can capture build pads or not (does not apply to space unit).
-Fixed Yoda's Galactic tooltips not indicating if unit can capture build pads or not.
-Fixed Skywalker's Galactic tooltips not indicating if unit can capture build pads or not (does not apply to space unit).


*MAPS (Land)
-All maps included in the mod have undergone a brush of more accurate passability brushing, to ensure smoother unit movement in gameplay.
-Trying to fix up maps with errenuous map/planet name properties, causing errors.

-Fixed Underworld Land Mission #06: Dark Ally. The Empire would retreat when outnumbered, and has been corrected so the entire mission plays out.
Fixed a bug on Underworld Land Mission 06: 'Dark Ally,' by replacing the icon for the Governor's Quarters from the prison icon to the proper Governor's Quarters icon.
Fixed a bug on Underworld Land Mission 06: 'Dark Ally.' The Guard Towers had no icons, and have now been given one.
-Fixed a bug on Underworld Land Mission 06: 'Dark Ally.' Some trees, roots and other objects were floating in-air due to bad placement (this was especially noticeable on the rancor den at the middle-left hand of the map). This has been fixed (for the most part).
-Fixed hologram advisor on UM07: "Cloud City Conflict" being a Black Sun pirate, when Darth Vader arrives and warns the player. The hologram is now, properly, a Zann Consortium soldier.
-Fixed rancor spawning den at the bottom of Carida. The den wasn't fully covered by the hill behind it, leaving a hole where you could see through the den. The hill size has been vertically increased to address this.
-Fixed rancor NPCs not spawning in Carida. Faction owner for the extra rancors being "Hutts" instead of "hostile." The extra rancors should now appear.
-Flattened some land in Honoghr and changed some passability brushing near the top-right most building placement point, so units (specifically Droideka MK. IIs) don't get stuck permanently on the slope south of it.
-The land where the saarlac inhabited in EaW wasn't flattened out when the saarlac was removed for FoC, leaving a huge, walkable indent in the ground. This has been fixed, and the base layout map in-game has been fixed to address this.


*MAPS (Space)
-Added a new variant, and fixed original. Tag "Alderaan" is now the default, alive version seen in EaW, while a new variant "Alderaan_Dead" has been created for FoC use. This was to correct a skirmish issue with the Alderaan map displaying asteroids in the load screen.
-Fixed FoC Alderaan still having weather indicators for rain, despite being destroyed asteroids. Switched to "Clear"/"Sunny," like the other space-only maps.
-Adjusted many space stations so all factions' space stations face towards the general area of the map/attacker entry positions to help with broken stations (COUGH Underworld COUGH) (Alzoc III, Atzerri, Anaxes, Bestine, Endor, Kamino, Kessel, Kuat, Mandalore, Muunilinst, Utapau, Vergesso Asteroids, Geonosis, Myrkr, Nal Hutta, Shola, Honoghr, Felucia).
-Adjusted Mandalore's first two attacker-entry marker so all attacking forces enter the map correctly.
-Fixed Muunilinst's defense turrets not appearing for all factions. Was set to "Rebellion" instead of "Neutral."
Fixed a bug on Underworld Space Mission 09: 'Baiting the Hook.' Fixed a super bad sequence where the Empire could outright retreat at any point during the mission (if outnumbered) before Thrawn retreats, causing the game to break. Retreat for both sides has now been disabled.
-Fixed Underworld Space Mission #12: "The Emperor's New Weapon." Removed broken characters from document (random "xxx" near bottom).
-Fixed Kessel's defender spawn points. Defenders shouldn't (if there are enough of them) spawn in the asteroid adjacent to the space station.
-Fixed Saleucami not having orbital special structure markers, so built gravity-well generators/long-range scanners couldn't appear in battle.


*MAPS (GC)
-Changed Bespin and its campaign varaiant's weather icon to the "Sunny/Clear" icon, instead of the "None" weather (that space-only maps like the Maw and Vergesso Asteroids use), to fix a holdover from EaW.
-Fixed Jabiim's land unit backdrop. It was showing the green grass/temperate mountains overlay when it should be swamp.
-Fixed Nal Hutta (and all variants) being defined as "Temperate" when it's clearly a swamp. Infantry should display the proper swamp clothing models in land combat for the planet.
-Fixed Nal Hutta (and all variants) using the urban/Coruscant land unit backdrop when it should use swamp (main planet used swamp backdrop by default).
-Fixed the campaign and prologue variants of Mandalore not having the Mandalorian warrior as the population icon. It was the default urban human.
-Fixed the campaign and prologue variants of Honoghr not having the Noghri warrior as the population icon. It was the default urban human.


*MISC.
-Fixed the armor type of the bunkers in GameConstants not being properly seperated.
-Fixed Rebel and Underworld turbotower laser color. Muzzle flash was green, laser red (laser has now been made green in the base template, as the muzzle flash can't be changed).
-Mass fixing TextID/tag errors for many objects.
-Testing a new system with R2-D2 & C-3PO and Darth Vader's file organization.
-Fixed all reinforcement points not having icons.
