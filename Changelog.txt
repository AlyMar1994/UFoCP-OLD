=========================================================================================
v1.1
=========================================================================================
There are MasterTextFiles_ENGLISH.dat updates in this update! Check "MasterTEXT Changelog.txt" in the game directory to see!


==================
A.I. (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-BuildGroundForcesPlan – In an attempt to get the AI to build certain ground forces, fixed (aparently) broken unit spawning for: (CONSORTIUM) F9TZ Infantry Cloaking Transport, (EMPIRE) HAV Juggernaut Infantry Transport & Imperial Field Commanders, (REBELS) Gallofree Infantry Transport & Rebel Field Commanders (all the lines referencing what should be built had "-" in-front of them when they shouldn't).

-BuildSpaceForcesPlan – In an attempt to get the A.I. to build fleet commanders, I've added the Rebel & Imperial Fleet commanders to the spawn AI. In the future, I may add Darth_Vader_Expansion to this list in order to get the Empire to build that, but for right now, baby steps (added lines "Fleet_Com_Empire_Team" and "Fleet_Com_Rebel_Team").


==================
Maps (Space)
==================
-Alzoc III (Alzoc 3) – Adjusted space station position so it points towards the attackers (for Empire/Consortium stations).
**These few maps edited are tests for community feedback.

-Atzerri – Adjusted space station position.

-Endor – Adjusted space station position.

-Kamino – Adjusted space station position.

-Kuat – Adjusted space station position.

-Mandalore – Adjusted space station position.
-Mandalore – Adjusted first two attacker-entry marker so all attacking forces enter the map correctly (faces toward the station instead of entering sideways).

-Muunilinst – Adjusted space station position.
-Muunilinst – Fixed defense turrets not appearing for all factions. Was set to "Rebellion" instead of "Neutral."

-Utapau – Adjusted space station position.

-Vergesso Asteroids – Adjusted space station position.


==================
Structures (Space)
==================
-Underworld Space Station(s) – Fixed almost all hardpoints; adding damage types for essentially all levels.
-Underworld Space Station(s) (Skirmish) – (Hopefully) fixed "Black Market Reactors" upgrades I, II & III for Underworld fighters, by adding the fighters' squadrons into the upgrade-modified fighters tag instead of just the fighter units themselves (Skirmish).

-Empire Space Station(s) (Skirmish) – (Hopefully) fixed "Enhanced Reactors" upgrades I, II & III for Empire fighters, by adding the fighters' squadrons into the upgrade-modified fighters tag instead of just the fighter units themselves (Skirmish).


==================
Units (Space)
==================
-B-Wing – Fixed shot-laser color from green to red. Muzzleflash was red, lasers were green.

-Crusader Gunship – Fixed death clone's Z-axis offset. The corvette should now explode and fall from its actual place in the world.

-Darth Vader – Edited squadron container so all of it says its good against/bad against the same thing.

-Rouge Squadron – Edited Rouge Squadron's conditionals for being in-battle with the Death Star II to "Rouge_Squadon_Space" as an attempt to get it to work.

-Vengance Frigate – Fixed death clone's Z-axis offset from -90 units to -100.
-Vengance Frigate – Fixed death clone's scale size from 0.76 to 0.9 (the model's actual size). The model should now retain size when destroyed.


==================
Units (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-Admiral Ackbar – Fixed remove corruption ability. It already existed (and essentially referenced in every file needed), but wasn't added to GameConstants.XML.

-Han Solo – Fixed remove corruption ability (added it to GameConstants.XML).

-Kyle Katarn – Fixed remove corruption ability (added it to GameConstants.XML).

-Mara Jade – Fixed remove corruption ability (added it to GameConstants.XML).

-Maximillian Veers – Fixed remove corruption ability (added it to GameConstants.XML).

*** While untested, it's possible that the AI will be a tad more aggressive in their corruption-undoing, now that the Rebels and Empire have more units to remove it instead of just juggling around the same 2-3 originally.

=========================================================================================
v1.0.1 - Hotfix #1
=========================================================================================


==================
Units (Land)
==================
-Darth Vader – Fixed regression by creating multiple multiplayer containers for Vader, fixing abilities and dueling issues in Skrimish land mode.
**New container "Vader_Team_Expansion" to go with original "Vader_Team." "_Expansion" is for land Skirmish, and is based on "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC) so dueling and abilities (such as Urai Fen's "block lightsaber") work. Space Skirmish still uses "Darth_Team" so Darth Vader still uses his TIE Advanced x1 in space (as "Darth_Team" uses "Darth_Vader" [EaW]).

-Darth Vader – Updated Vader's space Skirmish unit file so it has the same good against and weak against encyclopedia markers as the regular TIE Advanced x1 unit does.
**This change added the StarViper Fighter to the "Good Against" list, and replaces the X-Wing with the Crusader Gunship in the "Vulnerable To" list.

v1.0 - Petroglyph'd (Initial Upload)
=========================================================================================
There are MasterTextFiles_ENGLISH.dat updates in this update! Check "MasterTEXT Changelog.txt" in the game directory to see!


==================
General
==================
*Fixed STAR WARS (: Episode IV - A New Hope)' credits music.
**"Credits_Ep3.MP3" was an incorrect version of "The Throne Room/End Title" from a botched release of STAR WARS' soundtrack. It's replaced with a correct version.


==================
Factions
==================
-Empire/Rebellion – Fixing conditionals. Changing reference "Death_Star" (EaW) to "Death_Star_II" (FoC). Rebels and Empire will now use the proper advisor dialogue for when the Death Star II, Palpatine or Mon Mothma are in battle.
-Empire/Rebellion – Fixed Lose-to-Underworld music referencing "Lose_To_Zann_1.MP3" instead of "UND_Lose_To_Zann.MP3."

-Empire – Fixing "faction super weapon" type from "Death_Star" (EaW) to "Death_Star_II" (FoC).

-Rebellion – Fixed combination conditionals. Since Luke Skywalker can't destroy the Death Star in FoC (he could in EaW!), the Death Star + LSkywalker conditionals have been changed to Death Star II + Rogue Squadron (Wedge's X-Wing specifically, as Wedge alone destroys the Death Star II, none of the other squadron does). The Rebel advisor will now properly comment when the "Super Weapon Killer" is in battle with the Death Star.

-Underworld – Removed references to non-existant "finale" movies for galactic conquest.


==================
Structures (Land)
==================
-Bunkers – Fixed the armor type of the bunkers in GameConstants not being properly seperated, breaking the type. It should work now.


==================
Units (Land)
==================
-Darth Vader – Fixed HeroClash.XML trying to find "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC) when dueling against Obi-Wan Kenobi.
-Darth Vader – Fixed "object spotted announcement" for Darth Vader for all factions. Was searching "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC).
**In turn, added a new "object spotted announcement" for "Darth_Vader", since Skirmish mode still builds "Darth_Vader" in space.

-Urai Fen – Fixed Fen's unit file trying to find "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" for his lightsaber-block ability.

-IG-88 – Fixed the infection weapon's seperator in GameConstants. It's now properly seperated and should work.

-Vornskr – "Fixed" good against reference for Darth Vader; was "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC). No real change is made as it seems, but having it be referenced properly is always nice.


==================
Units (Space)
==================
-Acclamator Cruiser – Fixed the back-right turbolaser's damage type. Was normal laser damage ("Damage_Acclamator"), now it's turbolaser damage ("Damage_Acclamator_TL").

-Executor Super Star Destroyer – Fixing the SSD armor type. It's now properly seperated and should work.

-Rouge Squadron – Fixed good-against references from "Death_Star" (EaW) to "Death_Star_II" (FoC) for all squadrons/containers. Again, no real change but its nice.

-Skipray BlastBoat – Fixed squadron escort status; "Is Escort" is now "no" instead of "nos."


==================
Units (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-Grand Admiral Thrawn – Removed duplicate "activation style" tag in the remove corruption ability.
-Grand Admiral Thrawn – Fixed Thrawn's remove corruption ability sound from the Rebels' to the Empire's.
-Grand Admiral Thrawn – Fixed Thrawn's "complete" sound. It'll now play his own designated "complete" sound.
-Grand Admiral Thrawn – Fixed "object spotted announcement" for Thrawn for all factions. Was searching for "Grand_Admiral_Thrawn" instead of "Admonitor_Star_Destroyer."
