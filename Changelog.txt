=========================================================================================
v1.5 - Imperatoria Evigilationem Significasse
=========================================================================================


==================
A.I. (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-FireDeathStar – Modified A.I. to search for "Death_Star_II" (FoC) instead of "Death_Star" (EaW).

-DeathStarPlan – Added "IG88_Team" to the list of units the Death Star II should avoid when going about, as IG-88 is a "superweapon killer" (can kill DS2), as with Rouge Squadron.


==================
General
==================
-Campaign – Fixed Consortium Land Mission #06: Dark Ally. The Empire would retreat when outnumbered, and has been corrected so the entire mission plays out.


==================
Factions
==================
-Empire – The Empire awakens. The Death Star II and Darth Vader (with the Executor) have been added to the Empire's tech-upgrade A.I. The Imperials will now build the Death Star II and Darth Vader as part of their progression. The A.I. will prioritize building Darth Vader first.


==================
Units (Space)
==================
-Luke Skywalker – Changed Luke's X-wing tooltip from "TEXT_UNIT_LUKE_XWING" to custom "TEXT_UNIT_LUKE_XWING_01," to remove the "(Red 5)" indicator from the name (Red Squadron doesn't exist anymore, nor did Skywalker go under that callsign post-Yavin).


=========================================================================================


=========================================================================================
v1.4 - Hotfix #3
=========================================================================================


==================
Units (Land)
==================
-Rebel Infantry – Fixed "presence induced animations" for General Veers's now-removed cable attack death clone.

-Rebel PLEX – Fixed "presence induced animations" unused cable attack death clone.


=========================================================================================


=========================================================================================
v1.3 - Super Hotfix #2
=========================================================================================


==================
Units (Land)
==================
-General Veers – Fixed an accidental merge with another mod in-dev; reversed 1.2's ability to make General Veers killable with a Snowspeeder cable attack (everything else stays).

-Snowspeeder – Reversed update from v1.2; made General Veers' AT-AT untargetable.


=========================================================================================


=========================================================================================
v1.2
=========================================================================================
There are MasterTextFiles_ENGLISH.dat updates in this update! Check "MasterTEXT Changelog.txt" in the game directory to see!


==================
A.I. (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-AI_Plan_ExpansionGeneric_RemoveCorruption – Fixed AI trying to call "Darth_Team" (EaW), and "Grand_Admiral_Thrawn_Team" (a cut political unit that originally replaced Tarkin). Replaced Vader's with "Darth_Team_Expansion" (a team-tag added last update), and Thrawn's with "Admonitor_Star_Destroyer" to fix Vader and Thrawn's Remove Corruption AI.

-DeathStarPlan – Modified GameObject plan to avoid "Rouge_Squadron_Space" (Rouge Squadron) instead of "Luke_Team" (Luke Skywalker).

-UpgradeStarbasePlan – Added all Rebel, Empire and Underworld starbases to the list of buildable/upgradable starbases. The A.I. will likely start building past Lvl. 1 or 2 now.

-BuildGroundForcesPlan – Removed commented units from update v1.1, and removed their reference from the file entirely so the game doesn't try to build non-existant units.
-BuildSpaceForcesPlan – Removed added units from update v1.1.
**This was a larger mistake on my end. I didn't use my decision-making skills effectively, and implemented these flavor changes. They have been corrected.


==================
Factions
==================
-Rebels – Fixed faction-based orbital ion bombardment. Since the Alliance Assault Frigate nor the Nebulon-B Frigates have ion cannons (just lasers/turbolasers), they have been removed from the list of units that can start a Rebel ion bombardment (the only remaining units are the Home One and the Mon Calamari Cruiser).

-Underworld – Fixed generic faction infantry icon (seen in battle prompt) being the Black Sun Pirates infantry instead of the generic infantry unit (Grenadier) for the Underworld.
-Underworld – Fixed generic faction fighter icon being an unused fighter named "Virago" to the Starviper Fighter.

-Rebels/Empire – Modified factions file with some spacing changes (mainly conditionals).


==================
Maps (Space)
==================
**For space station adjustments (and what they mean), see update changelog 1.1!


-Geonosis – Adjusted space station position.

-Myrkr – Adjusted space station position.

-Nal Hutta – Adjusted space station position.

-Shola – Adjusted space station position.


==================
Structures (Land)
==================
-Repulserlift Jammer – Fixed Underworld VO. Removed lines from queue that still imply Imperial use of the jammer, or that the Underworld destroys the jammer when owned (e.g., removed line "The Imperials are using a Gravity Well Generator!" when the Underworld is the only faction to use it).

-Turbolaser Towers – Fixed Underworld VO for use of Skirmish turbotowers. Changed from Rebel VO to Underworld VO.
-Turbolaser Towers – Fixed Rebel and Underworld turbotower laser color. Muzzle flash was green, laser red (laser has now been made green in the base template, as the muzzle flash can't be changed).


==================
Units (Space)
==================
-Acclamator Assault Ship – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built Acclamators (was Empire, now Underworld).

-A-wing – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built A-wings (was Rebel, now Underworld).
-A-wing – Fixed Underworld-type A-wing being "good against"/"vulnerable to" own faction's units. Replaced "Crusader_Gunship" with "Corellian_Corvette" and "Skipray_Blastboat" to "Y-wing."
-A-wing – Updated original A-wing, gave squadron same "good against"/"vulnerable to" the FoC expansion gave individual units.
-A-wing – Fixed A-wing attack sounds; A-wings now comment when attacking hanger bays.

-Boba Fett – Attempted a unit re-code to fix an object contestation error (grossly named "Boba Mine Glitch"), as reported in the main thread, since that's aparently how all the cool kids are handling this issue.

-Broadside-class Cruiser – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built Broadsides (was Empire, now Underworld).

-Corellian Corvette – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built Corellian Corvettes (was Empire, now Underworld).

-Marauder-class Cruiser – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built Marauders (was Rebel, now Underworld).

-Moldy Crow (Kyle Katarn) – Fixed "Is_Escort" indicator being "np" instead of "no."

-Nebulon-B Frigate – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built Nebulons (was Rebel, now Underworld).

-Rouge Squadron – Changed conditionals back to "Wedge_XWing_Rouge."

-Tartan Patrol Cruiser – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built Tartans (was Empire, now Underworld).

-TIE defender – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built TIE defenders (was Empire, now Underworld).

-Tyber Zann – Fixed Zann's attack sounds; Zann now comments when attacking hanger bays and gravity-control-generators.

-Y-wing – Fixed squadron "Is_Escort" type being "Nos" instead of "no."

==================
Units (Land)
==================
-Canderous Assault Tank – Fixed amount of shots fired per-burst. The animation showed extra shots/recoil from the barrels, when in reality nothing shoots (leaving the tank shooting 2 times-per-fire with extra recoil). This has been fixed so the shot amounts line with the animation (shoots 3 times-a-pulse instead of 2).

-General Veers – Added an extra death clone for when killed by a Snowspeeder cable attack.
-General Veers – Modified death clones with the "IMPOSING_PRESENCE" behavior (and presence range), so Rebel Infantry units now respond properly with their "celebrate" "presence induced animation."

-Imperial Guard(s) – Fixed "presence induced animations" (i.e. standing at attention) in-front of Darth Vader, by adding the "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC) tag with the original "Darth_Vader" (EaW).

-Rebel Infantry – Fixed "presence induced animations" for General Veers (Empire hero AT-AT) by adding death clones to Rebel "celebrate" animations.

-Rebel PLEX – Fixed "presence induced animations" for General Veers' dead AT-AT.

-Scout Troopers – Fixed "presence induced animations" for "Darth_Vader_Expansion."

-Snowspeeder – Fixed Veers's AT-AT not being targetable. Added Veers's AT-AT walker to the tow-cable-attack ability, so the speeder can properly target him.

-Stormtrooper(s) – Fixed "presence induced animations" for "Darth_Vader_Expansion."


==================
Units (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-C-3P0 – Fixed unit tooltip using R2-D2's instead of his own.
-C-3P0 – Fixed C-3P0 not having a unit icon (Petroglyph assumed R2 having an icon would give 3PO one). Gave C-3PO his own special icon.

-R2-D2 – Fixed R2-D2's unit using both 3P0's and R2's icon instead of using their individual icons (hold over from copy+paste of unit container).
**An unintended side-effect of these changes now makes it so R2-D2 and C-3P0 are now seperate units on the hero-bar at the top of the screen. The units still are their combined team, and lead to the same single-unit, but they appear as seperate units on the command bar with seperate tool-tips and images. This is the opposite when they die/are stealing technology, as they combine into a single icon again.

-Kyle Katarn – Fixed improper defining in <Activated_Sabotage_Ability_Names>. No longer "Kyle_Katarn_Sabotage Saboteur_Galactic_Sabotage," now "Kyle_Katarn_Sabotage, Saboteur_Galactic_Sabotage".


=========================================================================================


=========================================================================================
v1.1
=========================================================================================
There are MasterTextFiles_ENGLISH.dat updates in this update! Check "MasterTEXT Changelog.txt" in the game directory to see!


==================
A.I. (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-BuildGroundForcesPlan – In an attempt to get the AI to build certain ground forces, fixed (aparently) broken unit spawning for: (CONSORTIUM) F9TZ Infantry Cloaking Transport, (EMPIRE) HAV Juggernaut Infantry Transport & Imperial Field Commanders, (REBELS) Gallofree Infantry Transport & Rebel Field Commanders (all the lines referencing what should be built had "-" in-front of them when they shouldn't).

-BuildSpaceForcesPlan – In an attempt to get the A.I. to build fleet commanders, I've added the Rebel & Imperial Fleet commanders to the spawn AI. In the future, I may add Darth_Vader_Expansion to this list in order to get the Empire to build that, but for right now, baby steps (added lines "Fleet_Com_Empire_Team" and "Fleet_Com_Rebel_Team").


==================
Maps (Space)
==================
-Alzoc III (Alzoc 3) – Adjusted space station position so it points towards the attackers (for Empire/Consortium stations).
**These few maps edited are tests for community feedback.

-Atzerri – Adjusted space station position.

-Endor – Adjusted space station position.

-Kamino – Adjusted space station position.

-Kuat – Adjusted space station position.

-Mandalore – Adjusted space station position.
-Mandalore – Adjusted first two attacker-entry marker so all attacking forces enter the map correctly (faces toward the station instead of entering sideways).

-Muunilinst – Adjusted space station position.
-Muunilinst – Fixed defense turrets not appearing for all factions. Was set to "Rebellion" instead of "Neutral."

-Utapau – Adjusted space station position.

-Vergesso Asteroids – Adjusted space station position.


==================
Structures (Space)
==================
-Underworld Space Station(s) – Fixed almost all hardpoints; adding damage types for essentially all levels.
-Underworld Space Station(s) (Skirmish) – (Hopefully) fixed "Black Market Reactors" upgrades I, II & III for Underworld fighters, by adding the fighters' squadrons into the upgrade-modified fighters tag instead of just the fighter units themselves (Skirmish).

-Empire Space Station(s) (Skirmish) – (Hopefully) fixed "Enhanced Reactors" upgrades I, II & III for Empire fighters, by adding the fighters' squadrons into the upgrade-modified fighters tag instead of just the fighter units themselves (Skirmish).


==================
Units (Space)
==================
-B-Wing – Fixed shot-laser color from green to red. Muzzleflash was red, lasers were green.

-Crusader Gunship – Fixed death clone's Z-axis offset. The corvette should now explode and fall from its actual place in the world.

-Darth Vader – Edited squadron container so all of it says its good against/bad against the same thing.

-Rouge Squadron – Edited Rouge Squadron's conditionals for being in-battle with the Death Star II to "Rouge_Squadon_Space" as an attempt to get it to work.

-Vengance Frigate – Fixed death clone's Z-axis offset from -90 units to -100.
-Vengance Frigate – Fixed death clone's scale size from 0.76 to 0.9 (the model's actual size). The model should now retain size when destroyed.


==================
Units (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-Admiral Ackbar – Fixed remove corruption ability. It already existed (and essentially referenced in every file needed), but wasn't added to GameConstants.XML.

-Han Solo – Fixed remove corruption ability (added it to GameConstants.XML).

-Kyle Katarn – Fixed remove corruption ability (added it to GameConstants.XML).

-Mara Jade – Fixed remove corruption ability (added it to GameConstants.XML).

-Maximillian Veers – Fixed remove corruption ability (added it to GameConstants.XML).

*** While untested, it's possible that the AI will be a tad more aggressive in their corruption-undoing, now that the Rebels and Empire have more units to remove it instead of just juggling around the same 2-3 originally.

=========================================================================================


=========================================================================================
v1.0.1 - Hotfix #1
=========================================================================================


==================
Units (Land)
==================
-Darth Vader – Fixed regression by creating multiple multiplayer containers for Vader, fixing abilities and dueling issues in Skrimish land mode.
**New container "Vader_Team_Expansion" to go with original "Vader_Team." "_Expansion" is for land Skirmish, and is based on "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC) so dueling and abilities (such as Urai Fen's "block lightsaber") work. Space Skirmish still uses "Darth_Team" so Darth Vader still uses his TIE Advanced x1 in space (as "Darth_Team" uses "Darth_Vader" [EaW]).

-Darth Vader – Updated Vader's space Skirmish unit file so it has the same good against and weak against encyclopedia markers as the regular TIE Advanced x1 unit does.
**This change added the StarViper Fighter to the "Good Against" list, and replaces the X-Wing with the Crusader Gunship in the "Vulnerable To" list.

=========================================================================================


=========================================================================================
v1.0 - Petroglyph'd (Initial Upload)
=========================================================================================
There are MasterTextFiles_ENGLISH.dat updates in this update! Check "MasterTEXT Changelog.txt" in the game directory to see!


==================
General
==================
*Fixed STAR WARS (: Episode IV - A New Hope)' credits music.
**"Credits_Ep3.MP3" was an incorrect version of "The Throne Room/End Title" from a botched release of STAR WARS' soundtrack. It's replaced with a correct version.


==================
Factions
==================
-Empire/Rebellion – Fixing conditionals. Changing reference "Death_Star" (EaW) to "Death_Star_II" (FoC). Rebels and Empire will now use the proper advisor dialogue for when the Death Star II, Palpatine or Mon Mothma are in battle.
-Empire/Rebellion – Fixed Lose-to-Underworld music referencing "Lose_To_Zann_1.MP3" instead of "UND_Lose_To_Zann.MP3."

-Empire – Fixing "faction super weapon" type from "Death_Star" (EaW) to "Death_Star_II" (FoC).

-Rebellion – Fixed combination conditionals. Since Luke Skywalker can't destroy the Death Star in FoC (he could in EaW!), the Death Star + LSkywalker conditionals have been changed to Death Star II + Rogue Squadron (Wedge's X-Wing specifically, as Wedge alone destroys the Death Star II, none of the other squadron does). The Rebel advisor will now properly comment when the "Super Weapon Killer" is in battle with the Death Star.

-Underworld – Removed references to non-existant "finale" movies for galactic conquest.


==================
Structures (Land)
==================
-Bunkers – Fixed the armor type of the bunkers in GameConstants not being properly seperated, breaking the type. It should work now.


==================
Units (Land)
==================
-Darth Vader – Fixed HeroClash.XML trying to find "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC) when dueling against Obi-Wan Kenobi.
-Darth Vader – Fixed "object spotted announcement" for Darth Vader for all factions. Was searching "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC).
**In turn, added a new "object spotted announcement" for "Darth_Vader", since Skirmish mode still builds "Darth_Vader" in space.

-Urai Fen – Fixed Fen's unit file trying to find "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" for his lightsaber-block ability.

-IG-88 – Fixed the infection weapon's seperator in GameConstants. It's now properly seperated and should work.

-Vornskr – "Fixed" good against reference for Darth Vader; was "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC). No real change is made as it seems, but having it be referenced properly is always nice.


==================
Units (Space)
==================
-Acclamator Cruiser – Fixed the back-right turbolaser's damage type. Was normal laser damage ("Damage_Acclamator"), now it's turbolaser damage ("Damage_Acclamator_TL").

-Executor Super Star Destroyer – Fixing the SSD armor type. It's now properly seperated and should work.

-Rouge Squadron – Fixed good-against references from "Death_Star" (EaW) to "Death_Star_II" (FoC) for all squadrons/containers. Again, no real change but its nice.

-Skipray BlastBoat – Fixed squadron escort status; "Is Escort" is now "no" instead of "nos."


==================
Units (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-Grand Admiral Thrawn – Removed duplicate "activation style" tag in the remove corruption ability.
-Grand Admiral Thrawn – Fixed Thrawn's remove corruption ability sound from the Rebels' to the Empire's.
-Grand Admiral Thrawn – Fixed Thrawn's "complete" sound. It'll now play his own designated "complete" sound.
-Grand Admiral Thrawn – Fixed "object spotted announcement" for Thrawn for all factions. Was searching for "Grand_Admiral_Thrawn" instead of "Admonitor_Star_Destroyer."
