=========================================================================================
v1.6
=========================================================================================
** IMPORTANT ** With this update, the entire mod's undergone a heavy structural overhaul: all fixes have been re-written from scratch, files completely reorganized (for readability) and the like. Any changes that have NOT worked or survived are removed from the log. General file stuctures have also undergone organization improvements to help the discerning modder, this means duplicate tags, bad spacing and other things will be removed.

There are MasterTextFiles_ENGLISH.dat updates in this update! Check "MasterTEXT Changelog.txt" in the game directory to see!


==================
General
==================
-Campaign – Fixed a bug on Underworld Land Mission 06: 'Dark Ally,' by replacing the icon for the Governor's Quarters from the prison icon to the proper Governor's Quarters icon.
-Campaign – Fixed a bug on Underworld Land Mission 06: 'Dark Ally.' The Guard Towers had no icons, and have now been given one.
-Campaign – Fixed a bug on Underworld Land Mission 06: 'Dark Ally.' Due to bad "passability" brushing on slopes and certain hills, units could get stuck or fall through the map. Lots of slope passability brushing has been fixed/improved.

-Hostile – Fixed faction "Hostile" (hostile to all factions faction) not having the Hutts as an added enemy.

-Hutts – Fixed faction not having the Black Sun Pirates as enemies, but was vice versa.

-Underworld – Fixed generic "lose battle" music refrencing "Rebel_Lose_Tactical/Strategic_Event." It now references the "Underworld_" variant of that. The same music still plays, but at least it's properly checking for the right thing.
-Underworld – Fixed unit callouts for Tyber Zann. Underworld VO would say (for land) "Tyber Zann has landed!" as his space callout. This callout overall has been removed.


==================
A.I. (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-EmpireAdvanceTechPlan – Fixed Empire build AI to actually build Darth Vader. Forgot to port over a change changing the build priority to "Darth_Team_Executor" instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion."

-AI_Plan_ExpansionGeneric_RemoveCorruption - Fixed AI trying to call now-invalid tag "Darth_Team_Expansion" instead of "Darth_Team_Executor."

-GalacticFreeStore - Defined Tyber Zann as the leader of the Underworld.


==================
Maps/Planets (Land)
==================
-Carida – Fixed rancor spawning den at the bottom of the map. The den wasn't fully covered by the hill behind it, leaving a hole where you could see through the den. The hill size has been vertically increased to address this.
-Carida – Fixed rancor NPCs not spawning. Faction owner for the extra rancors being "Hutts" instead of "hostile." The extra rancors should now appear.

-Honoghr – Flattened some land and changed some passability brushing near the top-right most building placement point, so units (specifically Droideka MK. IIs) don't get stuck permanently on the slope south of it.

-Tatooine – The land where the saarlac inhabited in EaW wasn't flattened out when the saarlac was removed, leaving a huge indent in the ground. This has been fixed, and the base layout map in-game has been fixed to address this.

==================
Maps/Planets (Space)
==================
**For space station adjustments (and what they mean), see update changelog 1.1!


-Honoghr – Adjusted space station position.

-Felucia – Adjusted space station position.


==================
Maps/Planets (Galactic)
==================
-Bespin – Fixed a holdover from EaW when Bespin had no land map. Changed Bespin and its campaign varaiant's weather icon to the "Sunny/Clear" icon, instead of the "None" weather (that space-only maps like the Maw and Vergesso Asteroids use).

-Jabiim – Fixed the land unit backdrop. It was showing the green grass/temperate mountains overlay when it should be swamp.

-Nal Hutta – Fixed main planet (and all variants) being defined as "Temperate" when it's clearly a swamp.
-Nal Hutta – Fixed all variants of the planet using the urban/Coruscant land unit backdrop when it should use swamp (main planet used swamp backdrop by default).


==================
Units (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-Grand Admiral Thrawn – Fixed the unused Galactic-only unit. Fixed the wrong unit being referenced in the team, and fixed the icon of the team.

-R2-D2 & C-3P0 – Fixed Galactic tooltips not having units' original description, only the tooltip if the unit can capture build pads or not.

-Han Solo & Chewbacca – Fixed Galactic tooltip description not indicating if unit can capture build pads or not (does not apply to space unit).


==================
Units (Land)
==================
-Dark Trooper (Phase I) – Fixed inconsistient 'Sprint' ability. The modifier to take less damage when sprinting was ".50" in the group section, and ".75" for the individual unit. It has now been corrected to ".50" for both. Dark Trooper Phase Is will now only take .50x damage when sprinting, instead of .75x, to make them less of a crappy meat shield and more of a good anti-infantry unit. In addition, the speed multiplier has been equalized at a 1.50x increase instead of x2.00.

-Darth Vader – Fixed unit type (again). Replaced my custom-made "Darth_Team_Expansion" tag with the official "Darth_Team_Executor" tag that was hiding in the Executor's unit file. The change should reletively be pointless; Darth Vader's FoC variant should still replace land battles in Skirmish, with the same results.
-Darth Vader – Fixed ambiant breathing SFX. Gave unit proper behavior to process ambiant SFX sounds, so now Vader's ambiant breathing should play randomly.

-General Veers – Added a hero blob insignia to Veers's AT-AT, as he was the only Empire hero not to have one. Veers now has the Empire symbol ring when highlighted/selected/stagnant by default.

-Luke Skywalker – Fixed Galactic tooltips not indicating if unit can capture build pads or not (does not apply to space unit).

-R2D2 & C3P0 – Fixed R2's "Hack Turret" ability not working on Skirmish-owned Underworld turbolaser towers.

-Yoda – Fixed Galactic tooltips not indicating if unit can capture build pads or not.

-Urai Fen – Fixed Urai's Cortosis Blades' "block lightsaber" ability not having a chance to block the Campaign Force Adept's lightsaber attacks, even though Urai has a chance to deflect all other lightsaber-using hero's attacks.
-Urai Fen – Fixed Cortosis Blades' "block lightsaber" ability not blocking Silri's lightsaber whip during Consortium v. Consortium battles in Skrimish.


==================
Units (Space)
==================
**The Expansion Hardpoints file has undergone an overhaul! All expansion units/hardpoints that didn't originally have a damage type assigned to them now does, which may affect their balance/performance (e.g. Bossk's lasers may now do half-as-much damage as before, due to having no damage type at all being changed to Damage_Fighter). Most of these changes won't be put in the changelog, but major ones will.


-Acclamator Assault Ship – Fixed Underworld-type Acclamator ship being "good against"/"vulnerable to" own faction's units. Replaced "good against" Crusader Gunship with Tartan Patrol Cruiser, and replaced "vulnerable to" Skipray Blastboat with TIE bomber.

-Arc Hammer – Gave laser cannons damage type "Damage_Acclamator." The Arc Hammer's laser cannons and now matched up with the Acclamator's.
-Arc Hammer – Gave turbolasers damage type "Damage_Star_Destroyer." The Arc Hammer's turbolasers will now match other Star Destroyers like it.

-A-wing – Fixed Underworld-type A-wing being "good against"/"vulnerable to" indicators for each fighter with the squadron's original list, so the normal fighers can't display info about being good against its own faction with developer-intended units (this fixes a regression from update v1.2). "Good Against" is now (by replacing the second one from "Y-wing") TIE fighters, TIE scouts and TIE bombers. "Vulnerable To" is now soley the Tartan Patrol Cruiser.
-A-wing – Re-fixed incorrect build/cancel sounds for the Underworld-type A-wing. It will now play Underworld sounds.

-Broadside Cruiser – Fixed Underworld-type Broadside Cruiser being "good against"/"vulnerable to" own faction's units. Replaced "good against" Skipray Blastboat with TIE bombers and "vulnerable to" Vengance Frigate to Victory Star Destroyer.

-Corellian Corvette – Fixed Underworld-type Corellian Corvette being "good against"/"vulnerable to" own faction's units. Replaced "good against" Starviper Fighter with X-wings, replaced "vulnerable to" Vengance Frigate with Alliance Assault Ship.

-Corellian Gunship – Fixed tooltip by fixing number of laser cannons in description. Now mentions the 4 laser cannons, instead of 2.

-Crusader Gunship – Gave laser cannons a damage type. Instead of doing full damage against everything, they now have the same damage type as the Corellian Corvette.

-Hound's Tooth – Gave fighter laser cannons damage type "Damage_Fighter." Bossk will now do half (if not 75% less) his normal damage to most heavier shielded units (Tartan Patrol Cruiser onwards).

-Interceptor IV Frigate – Fixed turbolaser cannons on ship. Was registering damage type "Damage_Acclamator" (anti-starfighter lasers) instead of "Damage_Acclamator_TL" (anti-ship turbolasers), as all other values in the hardpoints point towards the cannons being turbolasers instead of lasers.

-IG-2000 – Gave fighter laser cannons damage type "Damage_Fighter." IG-88 will now do half (if not 75% less) his normal damage to most heavier shielded units (Tartan Patrol Cruiser onwards).

-IPV Patrol Craft – Fixed unit having no selection UI ring when selected.
-IPV Patrol Craft – Fixed unit using incorrectly assigned "power to weapons" ability sound (was Corellian Corvette, now IPV).
-IPV Patrol Craft – Added the Underworld to the list of affiliated factions with this unit.

-Luke Skywalker (Standalone) – Fixed audio events. Skywalker still said EaW line "Red 5 here!" when selected in space. This no longer happens.
-Luke Skywalker (Standalone) – Made Skywalker's X-wing a variant of the original X-wing unit. This fixes multiple bugs: where Luke's unit image would display twice, Luke's fighter not hyperspace jumping into battle, and the extended health bar. No other stats to him have been modified, except undefined stats which are replaced by the X-wing template.

-Luke Skywalker (Red Squadron) - Fixed Luke Skywalker's Red Squadron X-wing, by making it a variant of the original X-wing. Some gameplay issues have been resolved with him.

-Marauder Cruiser – Fixed Underworld-type Marauder Cruiser being "good against"/"vulnerable to" own faction's units. Replaced "good against" Starviper Fighter with X-wings and "vulnerable to" Vengance Frigate to Alliance Assault Ship.

-MC30c Frigate – Added laser cannon damage type. Gave the ship the same laser cannons as the Rebellion assault frigate.

-Merciless – Fixed plasma ball type. Original plasma blast was the Star Destroyer turbolaser type, now it's the default Aggressor-class plasma shot damage.

-Millenium Falcon – Fixed weapon innacuracy distances. There were duplicate values; changed "super"-class ships innacuracy to 30.00 from copied value (1).

-Nebulon-B Frigate – Fixed Underworld-type Nebulon-B Frigate being "good against"/"vulnerable to" own faction's units. Replaced "good against" Crusader Gunboat with Corellian Corvette, and "vulnerable to" Vengance Frigate to Victory Star Destroyer.

-Skipray Blastboat – Evened out "good against" indicators on squadron/fighter. Individual fighters now have the same good against types the squadron does.
-Skipray Blastboat – Gave damage type "Damage_Fighter" to the laser hardpoint.
-Skipray Blastboat – Fixed ion cannon being labeled as a laser.

-Tartan Patrol Cruiser – Fixed Underworld-type Tartan Patrol Cruiser being "good against"/"vulnerable to" own faction's units. Replaced "good against" Starviper Fighter with TIE Interceptor and "vulnerable to" Vengance Frigate to Victory Star Destroyer.

-TIE defender – Fixed Underworld-type TIE defender being "good against"/"vulnerable to" indicators for each fighter with the squadron's original list, so the normal fighers can't display info about being good against its own faction with developer-intended units (this fixes a regression from update v1.2). "Good Against" is now (instead of the Mon Calamari cruiser and the Aggressor-class Star Destroyer) the A-wing, Nebulon-B Frigate, and the Mon Calamari cruiser. "Vulnerable To" is now (instead of having the Crusader Gunship and Buzz Droids included) now just the Corellian Corvette.
-TIE defender – Fixed hardpoints. The two ion hardpoints registered as proton torpedoes; so while they launched, sounded and acted like torpedoes, their damage was that of an ion cannon shot (as the values were copied and pasted from above). Their stats have been fixed to look and sound like ion cannon shots.
-TIE defender – Fixed Defenders not having engine sounds as they do fly-bys.
-TIE defender – Removed unused "attack hardpoint" line.
-TIE defender – Set squadron tag "Is_Bomber" to yes as it is a bomber.

-V-wing – Fixed Rebellion, Empire and Pirate V-wings to be affiliated/have correct build sounds per-faction.

=========================================================================================
v1.5 - Imperatoria Evigilationem Significasse
=========================================================================================
There are TONS of MasterTextEnglish edits due to the re-work! Be sure to check "MasterTEXT Changelog.txt" for all the changes!


==================
A.I. (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-FireDeathStar – Modified A.I. to search for "Death_Star_II" (FoC) instead of "Death_Star" (EaW).

-DeathStarPlan – Added "IG88_Team" to the list of units the Death Star II should avoid when going about, as IG-88 is a "superweapon killer" (can kill DS2), as with Rouge Squadron.


==================
General
==================
-Campaign – Fixed Underworld Land Mission #06: Dark Ally. The Empire would retreat when outnumbered, and has been corrected so the entire mission plays out.
-Campaign – Fixed Underworld Space Mission #12: "The Emperor's New Weapon." Removed broken characters from document (random "xxx" near bottom).


==================
Factions
==================
-Empire – The Empire awakens. The Death Star II and Darth Vader (with the Executor) have been added to the Empire's tech-upgrade A.I. The Imperials will now build the Death Star II and Darth Vader as part of their progression. The A.I. should prioritize building Darth Vader first.


==================
Units (Space)
==================
-Luke Skywalker – Changed Luke's X-wing tooltip from "TEXT_UNIT_LUKE_XWING" to custom "TEXT_UNIT_LUKE_XWING_01," to remove the "(Red 5)" indicator from the name (Red Squadron doesn't exist anymore, nor did Skywalker go under that callsign post-Yavin).
-Luke Skywalker – Fixed Luke getting attached to any random available ship when he has a usable space fighter.


=========================================================================================


=========================================================================================
v1.4 - Hotfix #3
=========================================================================================


==================
Units (Land)
==================
-Rebel Infantry – Fixed "presence induced animations" for General Veers's now-removed cable attack death clone.

-Rebel PLEX – Fixed "presence induced animations" unused cable attack death clone.


=========================================================================================


=========================================================================================
v1.3 - Super Hotfix #2
=========================================================================================


==================
Units (Land)
==================
-General Veers – Fixed an accidental merge with another mod in-dev; reversed 1.2's ability to make General Veers killable with a Snowspeeder cable attack (everything else stays).

-Snowspeeder – Reversed update from v1.2; made General Veers' AT-AT untargetable.


=========================================================================================


=========================================================================================
v1.2
=========================================================================================
There are MasterTextFiles_ENGLISH.dat updates in this update! Check "MasterTEXT Changelog.txt" in the game directory to see!


==================
A.I. (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-AI_Plan_ExpansionGeneric_RemoveCorruption – Fixed AI trying to call "Darth_Team" (EaW), and "Grand_Admiral_Thrawn_Team" (a cut political unit that originally replaced Tarkin). Replaced Vader's with "Darth_Team_Executor" (FoC), and Thrawn's with "Admonitor_Star_Destroyer" to fix Vader and Thrawn's Remove Corruption AI.

-DeathStarPlan – Modified GameObject plan to avoid "Rouge_Squadron_Space" (Rouge Squadron) instead of "Luke_Team" (Luke Skywalker).

-UpgradeStarbasePlan – Added all Rebel, Empire and Underworld starbases to the list of buildable/upgradable starbases. The A.I. will start building past a lvl. 1 Rebel space station.

-BuildGroundForcesPlan – Removed commented units, and removed their reference from the file entirely so the game doesn't try to build non-existant units.


==================
Factions
==================
-Rebels – Fixed faction-based orbital ion bombardment. The Alliance Assault Frigate nor the Nebulon-B Frigates have ion cannons (just lasers/turbolasers), so they have been removed from the list of units that can start a Rebel ion bombardment. The only remaining units are the Home One and the Mon Calamari Cruiser.

-Underworld – Fixed generic faction infantry icon (seen in battle prompt) being the Black Sun Pirates infantry instead of the generic infantry unit (Grenadier) for the Underworld.
-Underworld – Fixed generic faction fighter icon being an unused fighter named "Virago" to the Starviper Fighter.


==================
Maps/Planets (Space)
==================
**For space station adjustments (and what they mean), see update changelog 1.1!


-Geonosis – Adjusted space station position.

-Myrkr – Adjusted space station position.

-Nal Hutta – Adjusted space station position.

-Shola – Adjusted space station position.


==================
Structures (Land)
==================
-Repulserlift Jammer – Fixed Underworld VO. Removed lines that still imply Imperial use of the jammer, or that the Underworld destroys the jammer when owned (e.g., removed line "The Imperials are using a Gravity Generator!") as the Underworld is the only faction to use it.

-Turbolaser Towers – Fixed Underworld VO for use of Skirmish turbotowers. Changed from Rebel VO to Underworld VO.
-Turbolaser Towers – Fixed Rebel and Underworld turbotower laser color. Muzzle flash was green, laser red (laser has now been made green in the base template, as the muzzle flash can't be changed).


==================
Units (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-C-3P0 – Fixed unit tooltip using R2-D2's instead of his own.
-C-3P0 – Fixed C-3P0 not having a unit icon.

-R2-D2 – Fixed R2-D2's unit using both 3P0's and R2's icon instead of using their individual icons (hold over from copy+paste of unit container).
**An unintended side-effect of these changes now makes it so R2-D2 and C-3P0 are now seperate units on the hero-bar at the top of the screen. The units still are their combined team, and lead to the same single-unit, but they appear as seperate units on the command bar with seperate tool-tips and images. This is the opposite when they die/are stealing technology, as they combine into a single icon again.


==================
Units (Land)
==================
-Canderous Assault Tank – Fixed amount of shots fired per-burst. The animation showed extra shots/recoil from the barrels, when in reality nothing shoots (leaving the tank shooting 2 times-per-fire with extra recoil). This has been fixed so the shot amounts line with the animation (shoots 3 times-a-pulse instead of 2).

-General Veers – Added an extra death clone for when killed by a Snowspeeder cable attack.
-General Veers – Modified death clones with the "IMPOSING_PRESENCE" behavior (and presence range), so Rebel Infantry units now respond properly with their "celebrate" "presence induced animation."

-Imperial Guard(s) – Fixed "presence induced animations" (i.e. standing at attention) in-front of Darth Vader, by changing the "Darth_Vader" (EaW) tag with "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC).

-Rebel Infantry – Fixed "presence induced animations" for General Veers (Empire hero AT-AT) by adding death clones to Rebel "celebrate" animations.

-Rebel PLEX – Fixed "presence induced animations" for General Veers' dead AT-AT.

-Scout Troopers – Fixed "presence induced animations" for "Darth_Vader_Expansion."

-Snowspeeder – Fixed Veers's AT-AT not being targetable. Added Veers's AT-AT walker to the tow-cable-attack ability, so the speeder can properly target him.

-Stormtrooper(s) – Fixed "presence induced animations" for "Darth_Vader_Expansion."


==================
Units (Space)
==================
-Acclamator Assault Ship – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built Acclamators (was Empire, now Underworld).

-A-wing – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built A-wings (was Rebel, now Underworld).
-A-wing – Fixed A-wing attack sounds; A-wings now comment when attacking hanger bays.

-Broadside-class Cruiser – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built Broadsides (was Empire, now Underworld).

-Corellian Corvette – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built Corellian Corvettes (was Empire, now Underworld).

-Marauder-class Cruiser – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built Marauders (was Rebel, now Underworld).

-Moldy Crow (Kyle Katarn) – Fixed "Is_Escort" indicator being "np" instead of "no."

-Nebulon-B Frigate – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built Nebulons (was Rebel, now Underworld).

-Rouge Squadron – Changed conditionals back to "Wedge_XWing_Rouge."

-Tartan Patrol Cruiser – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built Tartans (was Empire, now Underworld).

-TIE defender – Fixed build sounds for Underworld-built TIE defenders (was Empire, now Underworld).

-Tyber Zann – Fixed Zann's attack sounds; Zann now comments when attacking hanger bays and gravity-control-generators.


=========================================================================================


=========================================================================================
v1.1
=========================================================================================
There are MasterTextFiles_ENGLISH.dat updates in this update! Check "MasterTEXT Changelog.txt" in the game directory to see!


==================
Maps/Planets (Space)
==================
-Alzoc III (Alzoc 3) – Adjusted space station position so it points towards the attackers (for Empire/Consortium stations).
**These few maps edited are tests for community feedback.

-Atzerri – Adjusted space station position.

-Endor – Adjusted space station position.

-Kamino – Adjusted space station position.

-Kuat – Adjusted space station position.

-Mandalore – Adjusted space station position.
-Mandalore – Adjusted first two attacker-entry marker so all attacking forces enter the map correctly (faces toward the station instead of entering sideways).

-Muunilinst – Adjusted space station position.
-Muunilinst – Fixed defense turrets not appearing for all factions. Was set to "Rebellion" instead of "Neutral."

-Utapau – Adjusted space station position.

-Vergesso Asteroids – Adjusted space station position.


==================
Units (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-Admiral Ackbar – Fixed remove corruption ability. It already existed (and essentially referenced in every file needed), but wasn't added to GameConstants.XML.

-Han Solo – Fixed remove corruption ability (added it to GameConstants.XML).

-Kyle Katarn – Fixed remove corruption ability (added it to GameConstants.XML).

-Mara Jade – Fixed remove corruption ability (added it to GameConstants.XML).

-Maximillian Veers – Fixed remove corruption ability (added it to GameConstants.XML).

*** While untested, it's possible that the AI will be a tad more aggressive in their corruption-undoing, now that the Rebels and Empire have more units to remove it instead of just juggling around the same 2-3 originally.


==================
Units (Space)
==================
-B-Wing – Fixed shot-laser color from green to red. Muzzleflash was red, lasers were green.


=========================================================================================


=========================================================================================
v1.0.1 - Hotfix #1
=========================================================================================


==================
Units (Land)
==================
-Darth Vader – Fixed a regression by replacing the land MP basecontainer for Vader. This fixes abilities and dueling issues in Skrimish land mode. This MP team now bases itself off "Darth_Team_Executor" (FoC, with Darth_Vader_Expansion) instead of "Darth_Team" (EaW, with just Darth_Team). Space mode will stay using Darth_Team, as that uses the TIE Advanced.


=========================================================================================


=========================================================================================
v1.0 - Petroglyph'd (Initial Upload)
=========================================================================================
There are MasterTextFiles_ENGLISH.dat updates in this update! Check "MasterTEXT Changelog.txt" in the game directory to see!


==================
General
==================
*Fixed credits music. Petroglyph implemented a botched version of "The Throne Room/End Title" that was slowed down (released from a bad copy of A New Hope's soundtrack).


==================
Factions
==================
-Empire/Rebellion – Fixing conditionals. Changing reference "Death_Star" (EaW) to "Death_Star_II" (FoC). Rebels and Empire will now use the proper advisor dialogue for when the Death Star II, Palpatine or Mon Mothma are in battle.
-Empire/Rebellion – Fixed Lose-to-Underworld music referencing "Lose_To_Zann_1.MP3" instead of "UND_Lose_To_Zann.MP3."

-Empire – Fixing "faction super weapon" type from "Death_Star" (EaW) to "Death_Star_II" (FoC).

-Rebellion – Fixed combination conditionals. Since Luke Skywalker can't destroy the Death Star in FoC (he could in EaW!), the Death Star + LSkywalker conditionals have been changed to Death Star II + Rogue Squadron (Wedge's X-Wing specifically, as Wedge alone destroys the Death Star II, none of the other squadron does). The Rebel advisor will now properly comment when the "Super Weapon Killer" is in battle with the Death Star.

-Underworld – Removed references to non-existant "finale" movies for galactic conquest.


==================
Structures (Land)
==================
-Bunkers – Fixed the armor type of the bunkers in GameConstants not being properly seperated, breaking the type. It should work now.


==================
Units (Land)
==================
-Darth Vader – Fixed HeroClash.XML trying to find "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC) when dueling against Obi-Wan Kenobi.
-Darth Vader – Fixed "object spotted announcement" for Darth Vader for all factions. Was searching "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" (FoC).

-Urai Fen – Fixed Fen's unit file trying to find "Darth_Vader" (EaW) instead of "Darth_Vader_Expansion" for his lightsaber-block ability.

-IG-88 – Fixed the infection weapon's seperator in GameConstants. It's now properly seperated and should work.


==================
Units (Space)
==================
-Acclamator Assault Ship – Fixed the back-right turbolaser's damage type. Was normal laser damage ("Damage_Acclamator"), now it's turbolaser damage ("Damage_Acclamator_TL").

-Executor Super Star Destroyer – Fixing the SSD armor type. It's now properly seperated and should work.

-Skipray BlastBoat – Fixed squadron escort status; "Is Escort" is now "No" instead of "nos."


==================
Units (Galactic Conquest)
==================
-Grand Admiral Thrawn – Fixed Thrawn's remove corruption ability sound from the Rebels' to the Empire's.
-Grand Admiral Thrawn – Fixed Thrawn's "complete" sound. It'll now play his own designated "complete" sound.
-Grand Admiral Thrawn – Fixed "object spotted announcement" for Thrawn for all factions. Was searching for "Grand_Admiral_Thrawn" instead of "Admonitor_Star_Destroyer."


=========================================================================================
