Fixes are marked with a hyphen (-), and written in this format: "-[DIALOG NAME]: 'Orig.' --> 'Fixed.'"

THESE EDITS FOLLOW THE STANDARDS OF AMERICAN ENGLISH! Double-spacing where applicable is only fixed when generally inconsistient, wrong for the scenario or is totally broken. These edits/fixes follow the rules of trying to stay consistient and American English-correct.

Last of note, I am a human being and I make mistakes. Please point out text errors in-game through bug reporting!

v1.6
===================================================================================================


-Dialogue has undegone a large overhaul, and most (if not all) Underworld campaign (and tutorial) dialogue has been corrected, double-spaced and improved (most texts aren't double spaced, but dialogue is because of the non-serif pseudo-capitalized text being hard to read if not).
-Normalized the Darth Vader-Obi-Wan Kenobi duel dialogue, by adding character indicators (e.g. "Obi-Wan Kenobi: ") in-front of the dialogue.
-Fixed some ability tooltips (such as Bossk's "swap weapons" ability) by completing the sentence (adding periods).
-For garrison/production dialogues, periods have been added to complete the sentence.
-Any text that uses broken elipses character will be replaced with the correct amount of periods.
-Many planet text tooltips (in the base/space slot view and planet history) have been corrected to fix grammar errors/inconsistient text (i.e. improper capitalization of "emperor").
-Finished off autoresolve texts by adding punctuation to complete the sentences.
-Fixed tutorial texts by de-capitalizing incorrect spots (such as "'Spread Corruption' Slot..."), and period placement being outside the annotation marks, among many changes and consistiency modifications.
-Fixed most weather descriptions with proper ending punctuation.
-Added entry "TEXT_NONE" so the debug client would stop yelling at me for not having this text entry available. Contains text "None."
-Added entry "NONE" so the debug client would stop yelling at me. Same as above.
-Most planet information has undergone edits. Small period placements/other grammar fixes/consistiency fixes aren't recorded.
-Tactical information has been been changed in consistiency, as most planets' encyclopedia advantage matched the tactical advantage text while few others did not.

v1.5 - Imperatoria Evigilationem Significasse
===================================================================================================
Due to numerous untracked fixes and errors, I've redone the text edits from scratch.


-For corruption dialogues/mission briefs, the random double-spacing between "Our Defiler" and the end of the briefing has been removed.
-For corruption dialogues/mission briefs, corruption names have been de-capitalized.
-For construction dialogues, periods have been added to complete the sentence.
-For upgrade dialogues and garrison/production dialogues, periods have been added to complete the sentence.
-Auto-resolve battle hint texts have periods added to complete the sentence.
-Victory requirement text has had periods mass placed to complete the sentences.
-Some variable dialogue (such as the "Corrupting..." text) has had periods placed to compelete the sentences.
-De-capitalized various building descriptions for consistiency with building names.
-Any text that uses broken elipses character will be replaced with the correct amount of periods.
-Any text regarding "[Hero] Must Survive"-type capitalization will be de-capitalized to match other texts (where applicable).
-De-capitalize any non-name-matched title for the bounty hunter assassination text.
-All relevant instances of "Death Star" in FoC are now replaced with "Death Star II," the correct Death Star in-game.
-All hint text has undergone some revamp; fixed improper capitalizations (i.e., "Space Station" --> "space station"), grammar fixes.
-Most "indigenous objectives" have been space/grammar corrected (not posted, as they're all the same just slightly modified for each faction).
