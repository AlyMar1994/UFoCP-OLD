Fixes are marked with an asterisk (*). If an explanation is required (or extra info included), it's expanded upon with a double-asterisk (**).

THESE EDITS FOLLOW THE STANDARDS OF AMERICAN ENGLISH! (Yes, I am a filthy American) Odd spacing is not changed in these edits, as that was intended (unless it is extremely jarring, like sex-tupple spacing in the middle of a paragraph). The double-space seperating "Our Defiler" and the triple-space at the end of the corruption dialogs stay.

Last of note, I am a human being and I make mistakes. Please point out text errors in-game through bug reporting!
----
For any corruption mission briefings that are edited, their tooltips for the menus are also edited! They're not mentioned, though.

v1.2
===================================================================================================
*Fixed all campaign pre-mission monologues; double spaced them since they were in the majority (compared to that which wasn't).
*Fixed all single-player campaign mission holocron objectives. Mass period-placing, capitalization corrections, and other edits.
*Due to a huge majority (from which I hadn't realized the last few updates), all "*CHARACTER* Must Survive" texts will be de-capitalized/period'd.
*Fixed all bounty hunter texts; "bounty hunter" is no longer capitalized (and other titles that aren't proper in their context, "field commander," ect...).
*Due to ignorance of species-capitalization, all species name (like "rancor") will now begin to be de-capitalized.
*De-capitalized upgrade tooltips for improper nouns (e.g. "Fighters," "Infantry").
*Corrected garrison texts to include a period after sentence (match with the rest).
*De-capitalized more instances of "dark Force" and "emperor."
*Fixed descriptions of anti-vehicle, anti-infantry and anti-aircraft turrets being capitalized/mispelled.

*Grammar fixes to campaign/normal speech texts (double-spacing, ect...).
*Corrected some campaign/mission texts to accurately match the dialogue.
