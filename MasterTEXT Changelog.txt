Fixes are marked with a hyphen (-), and written in this format: "-[DIALOG NAME]: 'Orig.' --> 'Fixed.'"

THESE EDITS FOLLOW THE STANDARDS OF AMERICAN ENGLISH! Double-spacing where applicable is only fixed when generally inconsistient, wrong for the scenario or is totally broken.  These edits/fixes follow the rules of trying to stay consistient and American English-correct.

Last of note, I am a human being and I make mistakes.  Please point out text errors in-game through bug reporting!

===================================================================================================
v1.9
===================================================================================================
Due to numerous untracked fixes, errors and inconsistiencies (AGAIN), I've redone all text edits from scratch.  I hope this doesn't happen again.


-Spacing has now become far more consistient.  To prevent errors, all tooltips have been reverted, or fixed to single-spaced.  All dialogue, world descriptions, campaign journal entries, and scenario descriptions will be double-spaced so they're easily readable, and absent of spacing errors (for consistiency between the ones that are and are not).  This also means that all erenuous spacing will be removed.  All developer comments from now on is also going to be double-spaced.
-Dialogue from all tutorial campaigns, and the main story campaign have been fixed and improved upon.  They now are more consistient, and convey more (i.e. Tyber Zann: "...by selling it to the Empire! [Hearty Laughter")
-All apostrophes have been fixed.  Instead of using the Apple-styled fancy curved apostrophes, they're now the natural '.
-Fixed all capitalizations of "emperor."  In the '90s, Emperor Palpatine wasn't named.  From the Return of the Jedi, he was only "The Emperor," which became his name.  Now that The Phantom Menace and the Revenge of the Sith have been released, the Emperor's name became Palpatine.  As such, all improper capitalizations of "Emperor" that are referring to the man as a sole title are decapitalized.
-All "Bounty Hunter" texts (i.e. "A Bounty Hunter has temporarily neutralized Boba Fett! Location:") have been decapitalized as "bounty hunter" is a profession, and is naming a hunter ambiguously, not directly.
-Fixed most cases of using the elipses character ("…") instead of "...".  I am aiming to end every case of it, and should fix up broken characters.  The same fix applies to broken apostrophes ("’"), being replaced with regular ("'"). 
-Added periods to all galactic conquest completion requirements, to complete their sentences.
-Many of Bossk's lines have been fixed.  Most of the time, the dialogue was too long for the sound file.  Most, if not all dialogue has been changed somewhat to fit the audio snippet fer better, while the content of the dialogue remains unchanged.
-On conversation with Jabba the Hutt, to fix up some text clipping errors on lower resolutions, "(translated)" has been switched to "[Translated]."  Bossk's dialogue earns the same treatment.

-Created string "TEXT_ENCYCLOPEDIA_RESEARCH_01" to adjust text for the Imperial Research Facility so it says it helps research for the Death Star II.
-Created string "TEXT_ENCYCLOPEDIA_TECH_UPGRADE_05_01" to adjust text for Imperial upgrade-to-tech-5 focus. Mentions Death Star II instead of I.
-Created string "TEXT_SPEECH_BESTINE_BLK_VICTORY_COR07_05_01" to fix major dialogue bug with corrupting Bestine under a black market.  Bestine *has* special corruption text if you use black market corruption, but the audio was never recorded.  The captions are now correct with the actual line that is being used in-place by default.
-Created string "TEXT_UNIT_LUKE_XWING_01" to fix error in Luke Skywalker's X-wing name.  He no longer uses the Red 5 callsign, as Red Squadron no longer exists.
