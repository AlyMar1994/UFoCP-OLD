A comprehensive bug-fixing mod for Petroglyph's "STAR WARS: Empire at War – Forces of Corruption" ("FoC") expansion. The goal of the Unofficial Forces of Corruption Patch (also "UFoCP") is to correct as many errors that Petroglyph ignored within FoC as possible, to whatever limit is available within the Alamo engine.

[b]NOTE:[/b]
THIS REQUIRES THE LATEST UPDATED PATCH FOR FoC ONLY! [u]RETAIL VERSIONS ARE NOT SUPPORTED[/u], ONLY Steam COPIES! [u]THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR THE MACINTOSH VERSION OF THE GAME![/u]

Star Wars: Empire at War – Forces of Corruption: the eight-month-in-dev expansion. On its release, Forces of Corruption released with slews of bugs. Petroglyph released a bunch of patches in post, but many issues still remained.

The overall point of the UFoCP is to be a comprehensive one-does-all patch for FoC. The goal: to eventually fix every bug with FoC not officially resolved by Petroglyph, to the limits of what's possible in the Alamo engine and community-developed tools, in one package.

[u][b]MOD NOT LAUNCHING FROM "MODS" MENU[/b][/u]

Try one or a combination of these fixes:

1). Set Forces of Corruption's .EXE files (runme2.exe, StarWarsG.exe, swfoc.exe) to launch as an administrator.

2). Set Forces of Corruption's .EXE files (runme2.exe, StarWarsG.exe, swfoc.exe)' compatibility mode to "Windows XP - Service Pack 2."

3). Run the game in windowed mode.

If all else fails, run the mod directly with the launch option "STEAMMOD=1548018187."
