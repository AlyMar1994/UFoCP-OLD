MB_LAND_PLANET_FELUCIA_TUTORIAL,Located in the Outer Rim, Felucia was once a major holding of the Commerce Guild.  A challenging world to colonize, Felucia was a world teeming with fungal life forms and immense primitive plants.  Much of the planet has a fetid, humid landscape overgrown by forests of bizarre wilderness.  Many of the indigenous plants aggressively defend themselves.  Sharp barbs, shooting spores, and poisonous defenses scuttled early attempts at agriculture.  The hardships of settlement produced few cities of note on Felucia, including Kway Teow, Har Gau and Niango.  Felucia has become an exotic retreat for the wealthy and the poorly paid citizens who support their extravagant whims.

MB_LAND_PLANET_SALEUCAMI_INTIMIDATION,Governor Koong Eeth must be intimidated for the corruption of Saleucami to proceed.  Maiming Eeth, and putting him in the hospital for several months regenerating his body parts will put across the message that he should accommodate the Zann Consortium's special needs.  Our Defiler has assembled a strike team of our reservists to accomplish our goal.
MB_LAND_PLANET_SHOLA_02,Jabba thought that he could absorb all my planets and take control of the Consortium.  Shola was one of my storage houses for contraband, and Jabba wasted no time in stealing everything I had there.  Unfortunately, Urai chose Shola as the hiding place for the Sith Artifact - we need to get it back and destroy Jabba's forces before they manage to uncover it.
MB_LAND_PLANET_TARIS_INTIMIDATION,A Gungan duelist named 'Twitch' is the perfect target for intimidation.  If the Zann Consortium can frighten him, the rest of the world will fall quickly.  Our Defiler has assembled a strike team of our reservists to accomplish our goal.

MB_SPACE_PLANET_AETENII_PIRACY,Aeten II is known for its rare and dwindling supply of stygium crystal deposits, which are used in the construction of various ship-based cloaking technologies.  Setting up an Aeten II piracy ring on the nearby moons brings valuable credits to the Consortium.  Our Defiler has assembled a strike team of our reservists to accomplish our goal.
MB_SPACE_PLANET_BESPIN_PIRACY,Bespin provides the perfect set up for piracy.  The gas giant has many floating staging platforms where ships can hide.

MB_SPACE_PLANET_KESSEL_PIRACY,Kessel is infamous for its political prisons which require massive communication satellites to maintain proper order.  These satellites are weak to an assault by our Defilers.  Controlling them will trick Consortium enemies into sending ships to Zann-controlled docks.  Tariffs that would have been paid while moving through the system will be paid to the Zann Consortium instead.  Our Defiler has assembled a strike team of our reservists to accomplish our goal.
MB_SPACE_PLANET_MANDALORE_PIRACY,Piracy is going to be especially dangerous to set up around Mandalore.  I will have to personally take charge to make this mission work against the vicious inhabitants of Mandalore and their brand of space fighters.  Our Defiler has assembled a strike team of our reservists to accomplish our goal.
MB_SPACE_PLANET_MANDALORE_PIRACY_PROLOGUE,Piracy is going to be especially dangerous to set up around Mandalore.

Our Defiler has assembled a strike team of our reservists to accomplish our goal.

MBEM02_An_Organized_Resistance.TED,Darth Vader has been sent to the planet Thyferra by the Emperor to track down the Imperial agent conspiring with the Rebels.  Tracing coded transmissions, Vader leads an Imperial assault force to the surface, hoping to catch Rebels, and more importantly his target, off guard.  
MBEM03_The_Pirate_Menace.TED,Boba Fett has been hired for a hefty price to aid the Empire.  He will scout the pirate defenses and neutralize their warning systems before the main fleet enters the area.  
MBEM04_Space_Planet_Geonosis.TED,Grand Moff Tarkin has assigned Darth Vader to acquire the resources of the planet Geonosis.  To take full control of the planet, both space and land must be secured.  
MBEM05_Attack_on_Mon_Calamari.TED,The Emperor believes that the fiercely-independent people of Mon Calamari will inevitably aid the Rebellion if they are allowed the choice.  The planet must be subjugated to prevent their interference.  
MBEM06_Trouble_on_Kashyyyk.TED,A passionate rogue named Solo who had defected from the Empire some time ago has freed the Wookiees from their prisons.  In his irrational defiance, he is attempting to get them off-planet.  We cannot afford to lose the labor force we have established on Kashyyyk.
MBEM09_A_New_Weapon_of_War.TED,With progress on the Death Star proceeding on schedule, the Emperor has turned his attention to other weapons.

The demonstration is to be held on Carida, home to an important Imperial training facility.

MBEXECUTIVE_TACTICAL_DEMO,Located in the Moddell sector of the Outer Rim, this silvery gas giant planet is orbited by nine moons. The largest moon is the size of a small planet and is known as the forest moon or simply Endor. It is covered by savannas, mountains and woodlands with trees that reach thousands of meters in height. A wide range of intelligent creatures inhabit Endor, from the vicious and towering Gorax to the courageous Ewoks. The Ewoks build their sprawling villages in Endor's trees that are connected by suspended bridges, ropes and wooden platforms. Ewoks are deceptively innocuous, but are keen warriors and hunters capable of using their ingenuity and natural surroundings to their advantage.
MBEXECUTIVE_TACTICAL_DEMO1,A temperate planet in the Chommell Sector of the Mid Rim, Naboo is covered by thick swamps, rolling plains, and green hills. Unlike many other planets, Naboo lacks a molten core. Instead, the planet's innards are composed of a massive honeycomb structure filled with water. The planet is also home to numerous animal species and is inhabited by the peaceful Naboo and the more warlike Gungans. The Naboo typically populate striking cities such as Theed, while the Gungans dwell in exotic bubble cities hidden in lakes and swamps. Both the Naboo and the Gungans oppose the Emperor.
MBRM01_Space_Planet_Kuat.TED,Unable to get to Fresia directly, Captain Antilles decides to stage a diversionary attack on the Imperial shipyards at Kuat - a massive installation that constructs all types of Imperial craft.  Normally heavily defended, the Incom nationalization ceremony has reassigned the majority of its defensive fleet, leaving the shipyard vulnerable.  Antilles hopes to cause enough damage to draw the Imperial Star Destroyer Tyranny away from Fresia, leaving their real target unguarded....
MBRM02_Interpreting_the_Network.TED,Undaunted by the setback in their plans to steal the X-wings, the Alliance devises a scheme to fool the Imperial sensors scattered around Fresia.  An Imperial network uplink station on Wayland seems like the ideal way to steal codes for the Imperial sensors if R2-D2 can get to it unharmed.  With the network fooled, the Alliance can slip past Fresia's defenses with the Empire none the wiser....
MBRM03_Theft_of_the_X-wing.TED,Unwilling to let the X-wings fall into the Empire's hands, some Incom scientists have provided the Alliance with the location of the prototype craft.  With nationalization only a few days away, the Alliance doesn't have a moment to spare.  Soon the Imperials will descend on Fresia and seize the X-wings for its own growing military force.  The Alliance realizes that this will not be an easy task.  The facility is heavily guarded, and it won't take long for the Empire to realize what they're up to....
MBRM04_Kessel_Rescue,The infamous spice mines of Kessel are death sentences to any prisoners of the Empire sent to work there.  Receiving word that Incom's scientists and other Rebel supporters are being transferred to the facility, the Alliance wastes no time in staging a rescue before the prisoners can reach the mines.  Using the ion attack ability of the Y-wings, the Alliance can disable the shuttles, then Captain Antilles in the Sundered Heart can swoop in and liberate the prisoners before they reach Kessel!
MBRM06_Imperial_Liberation,Intercepting communications chatter from a developing situation on Kashyyyk, the Alliance learns of a raid being led on Wookiee containment facilities the Empire has established.   Wookiees are being released from confinement and arming themselves.  The Alliance must act to assist in any action that would free citizens from the clutches of the Empire.
MBRM07_Highest_Bidder,Dealing with the seedy underworld is always a risk, and this time the fate of the Alliance hangs in the balance.  A disgruntled associate of one of the Alliance's contacts has stolen critical data about their dealings, and is offering it up to the Empire... for a price.
MBRM07A_Rescue_Falcon,No sooner does Han get away from the Alliance than he's back in hot water with the Imperials.  Caught in a Star Destroyer's tractor beam while running illicit goods to Corulag, it's only a matter of time before his engines burn out and the Empire boards his ship.  The Alliance moves quickly to rescue him in the hopes of acquiring his services for a mission that only a smuggler could handle....
MBRM08A_Cargo_Woes,Typically, Han Solo would be stealing things from depots like this one - not adding things to them.  This particular staging area resupplies fleets from all over the sector, and traffic through it is heavy.  There are more Imperial ships passing through here per day than most systems will see in a year.  Cargo containers bound for a multitude of systems float around the facility, easy pickings for those that know how to circumvent the security.  The Alliance hopes that Han is one of those in the know.  
MBRM09_Borrowed_Time,Following the trail of information on this new Imperial superweapon, the Alliance has pinpointed one of Grand Moff Tarkin's research stations as a likely source of further information.  The cargo container Han Solo planted the EMP on has reached its destination.  Now, the Alliance assembles its fleet and gets ready to assault the station.  Shortly before entering the system, the Alliance detonates the EMP device attached to the cargo container.  Hopefully there will be enough time to search the station before the Imperial fleet responds....
MBRM09_Lost_and_Found,Han Solo and Chewbacca have once again found themselves performing yet another dangerous assignment for the Alliance.  This time, it's infiltrating a heavily fortified Imperial city... on foot.  Their goal is to find the schematics that the Empire has annexed.  Recovering these schematics may just be what the Alliance needs to get the Mon Calamari back into the fight.  Han and Chewie must work together to navigate the city, avoid or neutralize the Imperials encountered, and reach the supply dock, where they can recover the plans and steal a ship to get them off-world.

MBTM07_SPACE_MULTIPLAYER,Teaches the basic game play behind the Space Skirmish game modes.
MBUM01_A_CRIMELORD_UNLEASHED,Jabba used his Imperial contacts to get me thrown in prison. I've been in long enough to gain control of the gangs inside, at the cost of my own Zann Consortium organization almost totally destroyed on the outside. I've ordered my lieutenant, Urai Fen, to get a fast ship here and he's three days out. I'm going to escape and exact my revenge on Jabba and the Empire.
MBUM02_REMNANTS_OF_THE_DEATH_STAR,It seems the Rebels went and blew up the emperor's Death Star while I was busy rebuilding in another part of the galaxy.  Lucky for me, the corpse is relatively fresh and the scavengers have yet to pick it clean.  If the crew ejected the data pods, and if I can recover them before the Rebels, they just might contain information on the emperor's hidden vaults....
MBUM03_COMMUNICATIONS_BREAKDOWN,Jabba the Hutt found a way to break into Tyber's communications system.  Luckily, Tyber's techs managed to trace the signal to a relay station on Saleucami.  Jabba needs to be taught a lesson.  I will use my strike team to establish a beachhead, so that our land forces can take Saleucami out from under him.
MBUM04_VISIONS_OF_THE_PAST,Jabba the Hutt uncovered an old Clone Wars-era factory built by the Geonosians that was never found by the old Republic.  If I can get there first, I can take a large prize out of Jabba's slimy hands, and gain a lot of firepower in the bargain.  Urai has gone ahead to scout while I gather some reinforcements.  What could possibly go wrong?
MBUM06_DARK_ALLY,We're landing on Dathomir to search for a dark Force user to unlock the Sith artifact.  I'm surprised to see the planet under strict Imperial control.  It seems there are many secrets here the emperor himself wants to keep hidden.  It will be interesting to see what Urai and I can find....
MBUM07_CLOUD_CITY_CONFLICT,Darth Vader commands the forces on Bespin.  I'm hoping to plant clues in the raid for the tibanna gas, to make the Empire think Prince Xizor of the Black Sun is responsible.  I want the gas for the ships I can build with it.  Also, what the code-breaking IG-88 can do for me is vital to the completion of my plan....
MBUM08_REBEL_EVICTION,I need to set up a new ship production facility in the Vergesso Asteroids, but the Rebels already have a foothold in that location.  The Rebellion is easily frightened by a show of Imperial force, so I've sent Urai in some stolen Imperial ships to deal with them.  I get the territory and I put the blame on the Empire to deflect any fallout - a flawless plan!
MBUM09_BAITING_THE_HOOK,According to my plans, I'm meeting the Imperial contact on Carida, supposedly to sell the Sith artifact.  I'm naturally expecting a double-cross by everyone I'm meeting.  After all, it's what I would do if I were meeting them.  But a trap you know about is one you can use to your advantage....
MBUM11_RAIDERS_OF_THE_LOST_HOLOCRON,Urai, Silri and I are raiding the Imperial archive on Coruscant.  I'm going to get the emperor's personal passkey.  I realize fully that Silri is going to be a problem, but for now I'll just watch her closely and make sure she does my bidding....
MBUM12_THE_EMPERORS_NEW_WEAPON,The emperor's passkey is the key to unlocking my prize: the emperor's vaults, and enough wealth to gain control of the galaxy's criminal underworld.  All I have to do is fight my way through the remaining Imperial ships, not to mention fending off whatever Rebel forces come to investigate....

TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_12,Heart of the Maw
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_12_INTRO_E,The Empire wishes to use the Maw as a location for a research facility.  Both the Rebellion and the Zann Consortium also wish to use the location for their own purposes.  The emperor instructs you to capture the Maw along with four other key planets to further his plans.  You have 60 galactic days to do this.  Fail at your own peril.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_12_INTRO_R,We wish to wrest control of the Maw from the Zann Consortium; the location is ideal for a refuge due to the difficulty in navigating the area.  It would also be beneficial to the Alliance if we were to control four other key planets.  However, the Empire is attempting to interfere with our plans; we only have 60 galactic days to take control, or we lose everything.  May the Force be with you!
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_12_INTRO_U,The Maw is a location that attracts attention from all sides; the Empire wishes to produce a research facility in the location, while the Rebellion wants to use it as a refuge.  I want it because they want it.  With the Maw under Consortium control, along with four other key locations, my power will be absolute.  But we only have 60 days before the plan fails.  See to it!
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_15,The Shipyards of Kuat
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_20,Pirate Dominance
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_21,Origin of Corruption
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_21_INTRO_E,The galaxy is in turmoil following the Battle of Yavin.  Many of the planetary governments have seceded from the Empire, but are not ready to trust the Rebellion.  Meanwhile, there is a new force working in the background of the galaxy.  The Empire will not tolerate any interference, crush all who oppose us.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_21_INTRO_R,The galaxy is in turmoil following the Battle of Yavin.  Many of the planetary governments have seceded from the Empire, but are not ready to trust the Rebellion.  Meanwhile, there is a new force working in the background of the galaxy.  We must unite the galaxy against the evils of the Empire, while not falling to the temptations of the Zann Consortium.  May the Force be with you!
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_21_INTRO_U,The galaxy is in turmoil following the Battle of Yavin.  Many of the planetary governments have seceded from the Empire, but are not ready to trust the Rebellion.  Meanwhile, our operations gain strength in the recesses of the galaxy.  The galaxy is ripe for the picking.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_25,Empire Surrounded
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_27,Gateways
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_27_INTRO_U,The battle rages on for the galaxy.  We are separated from our enemies by a few core planets.  The struggle for the galaxy will hinge on the control of these planets.  Use your starting resources wisely in order to conquer the galaxy.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_30,Roles Reversed
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_33B,Clusters
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_33B_INTRO_E,The fools in the Rebellion and the Zann Consortium seek my life.  Let them play their games, I will play the rabbit for now while you go and seek their deaths instead.  Conquer Yavin 4 and Endor, and bring me proof that Mon Mothma and Tyber Zann will bother the Empire no longer.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_33B_INTRO_R,The Empire and the Zann Consortium have put a price on my head.  While I hate resorting to assassination at any time, it seems we have no choice in the matter.  Take control of Coruscant and Endor, and see that Emperor Palpatine and Tyber Zann are brought to justice.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_33B_INTRO_U,It is a dire time for the Zann Consortium.  With our major successes all across the galaxy, both the Rebellion and the Empire have put a price on my head.  If they wish to challenge me, then we will play their game.  Assassinate Mon Mothma and Emperor Palpatine, and take control of their current bases of operation: Yavin 4 and Coruscant.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_35,Empire at War
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_36,Rim World Conflict
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_36_INTRO_E,While the heart of the Empire is relatively secure, the Outer Rim is a constant plague of corruption and disorder.  The emperor wants the worlds of the Rim under control and his laws enforced; with the Rim in his control the Rebels and criminals will have nowhere left to run.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_36_INTRO_R,In many ways, the Alliance started on the Outer Rim.  Planets used being left alone by the Republic chafed under the rules of the Empire.  If the Alliance can gain control of the Rim, we surround the galaxy itself with a vision of freedom, an example to all who dwell closer to Coruscant and the heart of evil.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_36_INTRO_U,The Outer Rim worlds hold much promise for the Zann Consortium.  They are isolated and far from the Empire's center at Coruscant, and as a result are more used to freedom and the temptations that only the Consortium can provide.  If we control the Rim, we complete a noose around the galaxy that we can then slowly constrict, choking the rest of the Empire.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_44,Galactic Conflict
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_50,The Conflict Begins
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_56,Equal Footing
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_56_INTRO_E,During our battles with the Rebellion, we have noticed increased corruption and crime on many worlds.  The emperor does not enjoy hearing that the funds meant for the advancement of his military are going to criminals, any more than he likes Rebel scum interfering with his rule.  Remove the Zann Consortium and the Rebellion from the galaxy by any means necessary.  Use your initial credits wisely to upgrade and expand your forces.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_56_INTRO_R,Many worlds have been corrupted by the Zann Consortium, and still others have fallen to the iron hand of the Empire.  While I hate to divide our forces, something must be done.  Use your initial credits wisely to upgrade and expand your forces and remove the Consortium and the Empire once and for all from the galaxy.
TEXT_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_56_INTRO_U,Many worlds have been corrupted by the Zann Consortium, but the Empire and Rebellion are taking more notice of our cause and as a result, more of their forces are being devoted to eliminating the Consortium.  We are a much greater threat than ever before and as such, we will be seeing large scale attacks against Consortium-held worlds.  Use your initial credits wisely to upgrade and expand your forces, and prepare for my total control of the galaxy.

TEXT_CORRUPT_SPACE_FLEET,Zann Consortium Fleet
TEXT_CORRUPTION_ABREGADORAE_STORY_BRIBERY,Abregado-rae is a manufacturing and trade-oriented planet in the Abregado system. Because the Remma trade route goes through the system, bribing the officials there will prove most productive.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_AETENII_STORY_PIRACY,Aeten II is known for its rare and dwindling supply of stygium crystal deposits, which are used in the construction of various ship-based cloaking technologies. Setting up an Aeten II piracy ring on the nearby moons brings valuable credits to the Consortium.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_AETENII_STORY_RACKETEER,Stygium crystal miners on Aeten II are wealthy and highly susceptible to rigged games of chance, as well as the special entertainments the Zann Consortium can bring to the world.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_ALZOCIII_STORY_BLACKMARKET,A black market organization on Alzoc III brings in important technologies in that section of space. The new ship specs from the Imperial and Rebel labs will greatly strengthen the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_ALZOCIII_STORY_INTIMIDATION,The food commissioner is an important behind-the-scenes power broker on the planet. With him in our control, mining production levels can be changed at the whim of the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_ANAXES_STORY_BLACKMARKET,The 'Defender of the Core' and its top-of-the-line technology is a tough place to set up a black market, but if successful it will be well worth the trouble.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_ANAXES_STORY_INTIMIDATION,The fleet commander Flankar is located on Anaxes. Eliminating his compound guards and wounding him will spread fear among the many ship captains throughout the galaxy.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_ANAXES_STORY_RACKETEER,The fleet merchants of Anaxes are perfect targets for insurance peddling. We'll destroy some of their resources and then hit them up for credits to leave them alone.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_ASSASSINATION,Intimidation (Land Tactical Combat)
TEXT_CORRUPTION_ASSASSINATION_BENEFIT,BENEFITS: Disables the special ability of the planet. (Required for Racketeering)
TEXT_CORRUPTION_ASSASSINATION_ENCYCLOPEDIA,This mission requires the Zann Consortium to initiate land tactical combat on the planet to find the current location of a local official and intimidate him into submission.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_ATZERRI_STORY_BLACKMARKET,The marketplaces of Atzerri are almost ready-made for Consortium black markets; we just need to provide a little organization.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_ATZERRI_STORY_BRIBERY,Atzerri is already filled with criminal organizations all over the planet. Bribing several of the criminal leaders saves the Zann Consortium time and money and still grows our power base on that world.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_ATZERRI_STORY_RACKETEER,With the planet already seeded in racketeering organizations, all the Zann Consortium needs to do is take over control of those criminal elements and it becomes a win-win situation.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_BEGIN,Corruption underway at: %s.
TEXT_CORRUPTION_BENEFIT,Benefits:
TEXT_CORRUPTION_BESPIN_STORY_PIRACY,Bespin provides the perfect set up for piracy. The gas giant has many floating staging platforms where ships can hide. Tibanna gas is constantly being transported from the system and capturing some of the cargo transports is a perfect use for Zann associates.

TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONFRONT_01,We received word from some reliable sources.  Our spies have alerted us that the bounty hunter Boba Fett has been seen entering orbit above a nearby Empire-controlled planet.  He is responsible for the death and torture of many of our allies.  We need you to take a fleet and dispatch this threat.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONFRONT_02,You have done the Alliance a great service.  We have word that Boba Fett was able to escape somehow.  He's in hiding currently, but he may make a return.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONFRONT_TITLE,Confront Boba Fett
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONQUER_00,If we don't gain more ground, our cause is finished.  Deploy some troops and help free another planet to join the Alliance.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONQUER_01,Your actions have not gone unnoticed.  Volunteers to our cause present themselves daily, and many ask to be assigned to you.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_00,There are some troubling developments to discuss.  We are receiving early reports of massing Imperial fleets and signs are pointing to a significant attack in the near future.  Our intelligence has revealed the probable target and I trust you to defend the embattled system.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_01,The Empire has made its move and their ships will be exiting hyperspace shortly.  They believe this to be a surprise attack; let us hope that your preparations have been sufficient to turn that surprise around.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_02,A heroic victory!  The Empire will surely think twice before attempting to surprise us again.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_03,Clearly our intelligence sources underestimated the scale of that assault.  We must regroup and fight on. The Imperial blockade cannot be allowed to remain.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CREDIT_WINDFALL_00,Thank you.  We have found ourselves with a surplus of credits, and it's only right that you should dictate how they are spent.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CREDITS_00,Our financial experts are predicting a shortage of credits soon.  We need to stockpile our finances to weather the crisis to come.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_CREDITS_01,I am grateful for your assistance.  While you were away our scientists researched some new technology you may appreciate.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_01,We are receiving reports from pirate spies that the Empire has left one of their systems undefended.  This is an excellent opportunity to free innocent civilians from the oppression of the Imperial army.  Be advised that this information comes to us from questionable sources.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_02,The pirate intelligence proved to be a great benefit to our cause.  Be advised that the pirates serve only themselves.  Future pirate reports should be followed with caution.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_03,We have discovered that the information given to us by the pirates was false.  In addition they have betrayed us and are planning an attack against our cause.  Muster what forces you have and defend against this treachery.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_04,It was wise of you to realize the trap set by the pirates.  Let this be a lesson that not all information can be taken at face value.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_05,You have proven that you can master any situation, commander. You will receive a credit bonus for your performance under pressure.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_06,Not all battles end in victory.  Learn from your mistakes.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_ENLIGHTENMENT_TITLE,Pirate Enlightenment
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_01,An Alliance fleet was recently ambushed and captured.  We have recently learned that the fleet is being held at a secret location on an Empire-controlled planet.  We need you to capture this planet for the Alliance.  Not only will you be liberating a world from the Empire, but you will be adding new members to our cause.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_02,Your actions have not gone unnoticed.  Volunteers to our cause present themselves daily, and many ask to be assigned to you.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_00,The Empire has suppressed the Rebellion for the last time.  You must pay for the damage and destruction you have caused throughout the galaxy.  I will see that the debt you owe the Rebellion is paid.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_01,The Rebellion will never fall to the Empire.  You have destroyed Home One, but we will rebuild.  When the time is right, we will return.  You will eventually pay for your crimes against the innocent.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_02,Many brave individuals perished today.  They are heroes and will be remembered as such.  Our fleet is still intact and will continue to fight against the evil Empire.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_03,Your help is in great need, commander.  An Imperial fleet is rampaging through allied systems.  We must regroup and neutralize this evil before any more innocents are murdered.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_FLEET_TITLE,Fleet Rescue
TEXT_MON_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_00,We have received many reports from our spies concerning the Empire.  Apparently, many of the Empire's most influential persons are gathered on one planet.  This is our chance.  Take a fleet and dispatch the Empire's leaders.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_01,A great opportunity has passed us by.  Word comes to me that the Empire's leaders have gone their separate ways.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_02,Well done, commander!  Our targets have managed to escape death somehow, but they will not be able to command while they recover from your strike.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_HUNT_CAPITAL_SHIPS_00,Reports are coming in that several Imperial capital ships have been spotted in orbit above a planet controlled by the Empire.  We cannot allow the Empire to build large fleets unchallenged.  I need you to confront this fleet and destroy at least 3 of these ships.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_HUNT_CAPITAL_SHIPS_01,The Alliance is in your debt commander.  You have struck a great blow against the Imperial army today.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_00,Word comes to us that the inhabitants of one of the Empire's systems are revolting against their Imperial oppressors.  They will not last long against the heartless destruction of the Empire.  Act quickly, commander, as time is of the essence.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_01,We've received a distress call from a planet revolting against the Empire.  More and more innocents die every second we do not help them.  The entire populace will soon be wiped out if we do not respond.  Make haste commander.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_02,This is a sad day, commander.  Word comes to us that the revolt against the Empire has surrendered.  Their losses were too great to continue to fight.  It's a shame we were unable to help them in their time of need.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_03,We have been contacted by the leader of the revolt.  The entire populace of the planet is forever indebted to us.  If ever the Empire strikes at their planet again, they will rise to help us.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_INDIGENOUS_REVOLT_TITLE,Indigenous Revolt
TEXT_MON_EVENT_OPPRESSION_01,We have received a distress call that cannot be ignored.  The Empire has conquered yet another planet and the people are suffering greatly.  If we help, they have promised us that a local smuggler and bounty hunter will do our bidding in the future.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_OPPRESSION_02,Your actions prove your true loyalty to the Alliance and the galaxy.  There are many here who wish to serve under your command.  A smuggler and a bounty hunter have been reassigned to your command.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_OPPRESSION_TITLE,Empire Oppression
TEXT_MON_EVENT_PLANET_OWNERSHIP_FLIP_00,One of our allied planets has betrayed us.  It has come to our attention that the system's leaders have been cooperating with the Empire for some time now.  The system is a great loss to the Alliance.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_PLANET_WINDFALL_00,Our influences have reached one of the Empire's planets.  They have decided to revolt and join our cause.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_01,A band of underground Alliance supporters have been discovered by the Empire.  They are being hunted and need help fleeing to safety.  They have requested that we escort them to a friendly system.  Among the supporters is a wealthy dignitary who will reward you handsomely.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_02,The consular thanks you for the great service you have performed for him.  As a reward for your efforts he has decided to reward you generously.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_03,That did not turn out as we had hoped.  Perhaps you were not ready for the responsibility.  Unfortunately the refugees have perished and we will receive no reward.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_DESTINATION,Escort Refugees To: %s

TEXT_MON_EVENT_REFUGEE_TITLE,Refugee Escort
TEXT_MON_EVENT_RESCUE_01,The Black Sun pirates have requested our assistance.  One of their leaders has been captured and is being tortured by the Empire.  The pirates have come to us because they are unable to covertly rescue him.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_RESCUE_02,The pirates have managed to find their leader being held on the surface of that planet.  They have held true to their promise and are delivering a Venator-class cruiser to us in thanks.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_RESCUE_TITLE,Pirate Rescue
TEXT_MON_EVENT_SCOUT_00,Some of the Imperial fleets have been moving to areas of space with no strategic value that we can see.  I think an investigation is warranted, but sending an entire fleet would attract too much attention.  Take a stealth unit and explore this planet.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_SCOUT_01,Your investigations have proved most fruitful.  The information you've gathered reveal that forces are marshalling for an attack in another part of the galaxy.  Send a scout unit to investigate further.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_SCOUT_02,Your actions have strengthened the Alliance.  Many of the more wealthy citizens of the galaxy have responded with covert donations.  Use them well.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_STRENGTH_01,In some cases, a show of strength is more effective than diplomacy.  Citizens from an Empire-controlled planet are weary of the Imperial presence throughout galaxy.  They have shown interest in joining the Alliance, but first they require a demonstration of our strength.  If we can defeat the Empire or the pirates in a land battle, they will join our cause.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_STRENGTH_02,With our last victory, we have gained favor with citizens throughout the galaxy.  In fact, a revolt has taken place on an Empire-controlled controlled planet.  This system has sworn allegiance to us in our future endeavors.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_STRENGTH_TITLE,Show of Strength
TEXT_MON_EVENT_STRUCTURE_00,The Alliance needs every credit it can get.  Unfortunately, it does us no good if we don't use it to both protect ourselves and bring the fight to the Empire.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_STRUCTURE_01,I am in your debt.  Your actions have attracted a bit of a following - Volunteers have appeared asking to be assigned to your command.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_TECH_WINDFALL_00,You have done well.  We have some new tech available for you - It should help us in the struggle.  Your tech level has been raised one level.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_TRAP_00,Recent Imperial troop movements have created an opportunity to strike and liberate another world.  I would advise you to plan an assault, but use caution - a trap is always a possibility.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_TRAP_01,It seems as though the opportunity has passed and Imperial defenses are once again in place.  I have confidence that you made the right decision in refusing to be baited, but remember that an excessively defensive strategy allows the Empire to continue to expand their dominance.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_TRAP_02,It's a trap!  Bolster your defenses to survive the battle.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UNIT_WINDFALL_00,I am grateful for your presence, commander.  We have reallocated some units to your service.  I'm sure you will put them to good use.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UNITS_00,A base alone cannot protect worlds from the Empire - Fleets, ground troops and secondary structures all play a part in defense.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UNITS_01,You have done well in building our forces.  I have decided to allocate more funding to you.  Use these credits wisely.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_00,You are doing well, but our defenses need to be even stronger.  Upgrade one of our star bases to strengthen our defenses.
TEXT_MON_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_01,Your actions have strengthened our position in the galaxy. Word of your actions has spread and donations continue to flow in.  Use these credits wisely.

TEXT_PLANET_AETENII_INFO_HIS,A planet located in the Outer Rim. Plagued by volcanic activity, Aeten II is known for its deposits of rare stygium crystals, which are used in the construction of cloaking devices. Because stygium crystals are extremely valuable, a number of unscrupulous prospectors descended upon Aeten II, where they competed for the rare crystals with deadly abandon. As a result, Aeten II became one of the most dangerous planets in the Outer Rim territories. By the rise of the Empire, Aeten II's cache of crystals had been all but depleted, making the manufacture of new stygium-based cloaking devices a near impossibility. Prospectors looking to retool old mining facilities here have since found other valuable resources to mine.

Their society is immersed in high culture and education, and is founded on ecological principles that protect the planet's natural beauty. The horrors of the Clone Wars were taken to heart and the people of Alderaan adopted pacifism banning all weapons from the planet's surface. However the rise of the Emperor has caused a growing opposition to imperial rule and increased support for the Rebellion.

Over time, survivors of Sadow's people evolved into the deadly Massassi Warriors, who built dramatic temples throughout the jungles before they vanished into legend. Massassi temples can be used as ship hangers allowing for cheaper production of fighter craft.

TEXT_SPEECH_ABREGADORAE_BRB_VICTORY_COR01_01,Defiler: I've bribed the spaceport commissioner to stop the flow of garrison units from Abregado-rae to our enemies.  I've also acquired records of ship movements along the Remma trade route.
TEXT_SPEECH_ACT01_M04_BOUNCE,Tyber Zann: I want to deal with Jabba myself.  The battle will not begin without me.
TEXT_SPEECH_AETENII_PIR_LOAD_COR02_01,Bossk: [Translated]  Anyone not doing their part, I'll kill personally.  Begin the battle!
TEXT_SPEECH_AETENII_PIR_LOSS_COR02_04,Bossk: [Translated]  The forces you sent me were totally untrained and useless!  I've killed the survivors and am coming back to train new forces myself.  I'll not be stopped!
TEXT_SPEECH_AETENII_PIR_TACTICAL_COR02_02,Bossk: [Translated]  The stygium storage containers will be well guarded.  Destroying five containers and nearby enemies will help to secure our hold over Aeten II.
TEXT_SPEECH_AETENII_PIR_VICTORY_COR02_03,Bossk: [Translated]  The stygium capsules and enemy targets have been eliminated.  I expect my fee to be doubled for my success.
TEXT_SPEECH_AETENII_RKT_VICTORY_COR02_05,Defiler: The miners of Aeten II are exhausting their credit accounts in our cantinas.  We've even started to get stygium crystals as payment for their debts.
TEXT_SPEECH_ALZOCIII_BLK_VICTORY_COR03_05,Defiler: We've successfully set up a black market on Alzoc III.  Already, new ships of surprising power are being made available to Consortium forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_ALZOCIII_INT_LOAD_COR03_01,Tyber Zann: Now that I've come all the way down here, we clearly have to kill some of those Shaaks.  Let's say, ten heads!
TEXT_SPEECH_ALZOCIII_INT_LOSS_COR03_04,Tyber Zann: The Alzoc III forces put up a surprising fight.  I'm going to have to acquire more battle units before I try taking this planet again.
TEXT_SPEECH_ALZOCIII_INT_TACTICAL_COR03_02,Tyber Zann: I'm taking a few associates down to the planet, to rough up the food commissioner.  Once we have him under our thumb, I'll control the output of the entire planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_ALZOCIII_INT_VICTORY_COR03_03,Tyber Zann: The commissioner is now under our control.  We'll start by limiting the miners food supply until they dramatically increase their production!
TEXT_SPEECH_ANAXES_INT_LOAD_COR04_01,Bossk: [Translated]  Move your lazy hides, I want this mission over quickly!
TEXT_SPEECH_ANAXES_INT_LOSS_COR04_04,Bossk: [Translated]  There were hidden reserves of troops on-planet.  We'll go in much better prepared if we attack in the near future.
TEXT_SPEECH_ANAXES_INT_TACTICAL_COR04_02,Bossk: [Translated]  Fleet Commander Flankar has a galaxy-wide reputation as being the best.  Once we demonstrate our power,  he will be easily controlled by the Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_ANAXES_INT_VICTORY_COR04_03,Bossk: [Translated]  The entire Perlemian trade route is in our control.  We'll now be able to put a stranglehold on half the free trade of the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_ANAXES_RKT_VICTORY_COR04_05,Defiler: Our organization has targeted the merchant crews coming to the planet for entertainment.  I expect this operation will be very lucrative.
TEXT_SPEECH_ATZERRI_BRB_VICTORY_COR05_02,Defiler: Bribery on Atzerri has exceeded our wildest expectations.  The planet is completely corrupt, and massive credit deposits are coming our way...
TEXT_SPEECH_ATZERRI_RKT_VICTORY_COR05_01,Defiler: Our racketeering efforts were extremely successful on the criminally corrupt world of Atzerri.  Crime bosses almost stood in-line to get a piece of our operations there.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_LOAD_COR06_01,Tyber Zann: We'll advance into the system and destroy the next tibanna gas shipment.  That should make it easier for us to gain credits for our own fleet buildups.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_LOSS_COR06_04,Tyber Zann: The death squadrons guarding the tibanna gas shipments proved stronger than we expected.  We'll have to go back and gather more forces if we're to corrupt this system.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_02,Tyber Zann: I have no intention of staying here long.  Destroy our enemies ships and prepare for the next battle.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_06,Tyber Zann: We've managed to bribe and capture an Imperial Interdictor.  We will be using the Interdictor to pull tibanna gas convoys out of hyperspace.  For this plan to work, the Interdictor will need to activate its ability near the Bespin shipping lanes.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_07,Tyber Zann: The first convoy should be arriving any time now.  We'll need to destroy the tibanna shuttles before they escape the range of the Interdictor.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_08,Tibanna Merchant: It's an ambush!  Take evasive action!
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_09,Tyber Zann: Destroying another convoy should be sufficient to put some fear into Bespin's government.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_10,Tibanna Merchant: Pirates!  All hands defend the Tibanna shuttle!
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_TACTICAL_COR06_11,Tyber Zann: Good work.  Bespin is now under the... 'protection' of the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_PIR_VICTORY_COR06_03,Tyber Zann: Tibanna shipments to our enemies will now slow down to a crawl.  We should gain enough credits to begin a rapid build up of Zann Consortium space fleets.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESPIN_RKT_VICTORY_COR06_05,Defiler: Corruption has taken hold of the Cloud City populace.  The few other worthwhile targets there will soon be under our control as well.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESTINE_BLK_VICTORY_COR07_05,(UNUSED, NO AUDIO) Defiler: Bestine's many technological facilities now regularly release their products to our black market; the steady traffic insures that the Consortium is never short on credits or new weapons.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESTINE_BLK_VICTORY_COR07_05_01,Defiler: A black market has been established, and is providing important information.  Tyber's plans are moving forward...
TEXT_SPEECH_BESTINE_KID_LOAD_COR07_01,IG-88: Our plans are set with an 87% chance of success.  Begin the mission.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESTINE_KID_LOSS_COR07_04,IG-88: I clearly need more forces for this difficult target.  Mass more units, and we will strike again.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESTINE_KID_TACTICAL_COR07_02,IG-88: The commander Ral Falan is the most powerful man on the planet.  Taking him hostage and acquiring his plans and secrets could have galaxy-wide effects.
TEXT_SPEECH_BESTINE_KID_VICTORY_COR07_03,IG-88: Torture droids are penetrating the brain of our hostage.  Soon, we will know his plans and be able to use that information accordingly.
TEXT_SPEECH_BONADAN_CRM_VICTORY_COR08_02,Defiler: Special Bonadan military units have joined the us, and will revolt against enemy leaders who try and put an end our corruption on the planet.  Power to the Consortium!

TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_10A_INTRO_E,Imperial defenses are failing throughout the galaxy; only three planets still belong to the Empire, and they are weak and undefended.  If the Empire is to survive, you must push back the Rebel offensive.  You will be granted 5,000 initial credits for the strengthening of your forces.  Beware of outlying Pirate-controlled worlds who stand in your way.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_10A_INTRO_R,Only a small group of systems remain under Imperial control, and war has taken its toll on the galaxy.  As a result, both sides must build from the ground up to advance.  Use the 5,000 starting credits to remove the remains of the Empire from the galaxy.  Beware of outlying pirate-controlled systems in the galaxy that hold no ties with either side.

TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_15_INTRO_R,Reports have surfaced that the Empire is dedicating most of their production to building Star Destroyers at the Kuat shipyards.  The Empire cannot be allowed to gain a production advantage in space.  Use this 8,000 credits allocated to aid you in taking control of Fondor, Fresia and Kuat.  You must hurry; if you cannot complete your task in 20 days, all will be lost.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_20_INTRO_E,The Empire's foothold in the galaxy has been compromised.  Pirates have run rampant across many systems.  Use your initial 3,000 credits to secure control of both the Pirate and Rebel-controlled planets.

TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_25_INTRO_E,This Rebellion has subverted many of the outlying systems of the galaxy and the Empire is in dire peril of losing Coruscant.  Imperial forces have pulled back and fortified the Core Worlds, but it is only a matter of time before the Rebels begin their assault.  A sum total of 9,000 credits has been made available to you.  Rebuild the Imperial Navy, destroy the Rebels, and protect the Emperor at all costs.

TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_30_INTRO_E,Imperial forces have managed to flee to the fringes of the galaxy.  Due to the strain of war and mismanagement by corrupt Imperial officials, you have only 5,000 credits left to retake the Core Worlds and the galaxy.

TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_35_INTRO_E,The Empire has underestimated the resourcefulness of the Rebellion.  While we were fighting battles on the outer rim, several Core worlds have fallen to Rebel attacks.  As a result, Imperial forces have been fractured.  The Rebel presence persists in every corner of the galaxy.  You have 6,000 credits to use for the reconstruction of Imperial forces.

TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_50_INTRO_E,Coruscant is the center of Empire, both literally and figuratively.  While the outlying systems claim fealty, the Emperor wishes to take a more active role in their control.  Use these 8,000 credits to take the might of the Empire wherever you can.  You may run across small pockets of a newly-formed Rebellion - crush them whenever possible.
TEXT_SPEECH_CAMPAIGN_SINGLE_50_INTRO_R,The Alliance is small, holding only one planet as a base of operations.  The Empire has consolidated their presence in the center of the galaxy.  Both sides hold little advantage.  The Rebels must use every conceivable means to bring the galaxy back together under a banner of freedom.  You have 8,000 credits to bolster your forces, but survival depends on spreading the Rebellion to new planets.

TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_58,Darth Vader: Begin your interrogation immediately, Captain.  This pirate may know the identity of the traitor we seek.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_59,Imperial Officer: Yes, my lord.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_60,Imperial Officer: The bounty hunter has failed - all hands prepare for hyperspace!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_61,Darth Vader: I will not tolerate mistakes, Fett.  Bring down the pirate leader's defenses immediately.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_62,Boba Fett: This is my bounty!  Don't even think of starting without me!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_64,Boba Fett: Take out those turrets!  Target the asteroid's hardpoints!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_70,Boba Fett: If there's no target, there's no deal.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_71,Darth Vader: Do not overestimate your value to the Empire, Fett, but your services are required here.  Our target is the pirate leader, and he will be taken alive.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_00,Boba Fett: I've deciphered the transmission.  The message to the Jedi came from the planet Thyferra.  The Rebels must have a base there.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_01,Darth Vader: I will see to these Rebels personally.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_07,Stormtrooper: Sir, we've located a Rebel outpost just over the hill.  Looks like they've been using an abandoned communications tower to listen in to our transmissions.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_08,Darth Vader: Have the Rebels detected us yet?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_09,Stormtrooper: No sir.  We jammed their sensors before we landed.  We've been holding back waiting for your arrival.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_10,Darth Vader: So much the better.  We will catch them off guard.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_11,Darth Vader: Secure and fortify that location to bring in reinforcements.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_13,Darth Vader: We must take down this shield before we attack.  Destroy the power source before we advance on the base.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_15,Stormtrooper: Sir, the Rebels got out a warning before we could secure the communications array.  It's likely the other Rebel groups nearby will be on alert now.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_16,Darth Vader: If this is the best they can muster, the Rebels are of no great concern to the Empire.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_17,Stormtrooper: We've found equipment that carries pirate insignias.  The Rebels may be working with them.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_18,Darth Vader: This traitor must be using these pirates to conceal his connections to the Rebellion.  Reconstruct any communication logs you can and inform me as soon as you have something.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_19,Stormtrooper: Yes, sir!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_20,Imperial Officer: My lord, reports are coming in from Fondor that Rebel forces have routed our troops and taken control of some local settlements.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_21,Darth Vader: This meaningless retaliation only serves to give away their location.  Eliminate them quickly and recover any communications you may find in the rubble.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_24,Imperial Officer: My lord, we've located a small Rebel outpost using the nearby abandoned communications tower to receive Imperial transmissions.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_25,Darth Vader: Have the Rebels detected our presence?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_26,Imperial Officer: No, my lord.  We jammed their sensors and communications before we landed.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_27,Darth Vader: I hope that you are not mistaken, commander.  We will eliminate the Rebel forces here and discover the identity of the traitor with one swift strike.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_28,Imperial Officer: Yes, sir.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_29,Imperial Officer: Sir! The Rebels got out a warning before we could secure the communications array.  It's likely that other Rebel groups in the area will...
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_30,Darth Vader: Most unfortunate.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_31,Darth Vader: I warned you of the consequences of failing me, commander.  I can only hope your replacement will be more tactful.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_32,Darth Vader: Trooper, did you find anything in your search?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_33,Stormtrooper: Some of the equipment we've found carries pirate insignias.  The Rebels may be working with them.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_34,Darth Vader: They must be trading information on our cargo routes for supplies from the pirates.  Reconstruct their communications.  They will lead us to the Rebellion.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_35,Darth Vader: The Rebels will see no more use from this communications center - destroy it!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_36,Rebel Soldier: Imperial forces! Start the evacuation!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_41,Darth Vader: We cannot give away our presence.  Send the probe droid!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_42,Darth Vader: Build a strike force and escort Boba Fett to Ilum.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_43,Darth Vader: Exterminate the Rebel scum on Fondor.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_44,Rebel Soldier:  My comm.  hasn't worked all morning...I have a bad feeling about this.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_45,Rebel Soldier:  Stormtroopers!  They've found us!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_46,Rebel Soldier:  Imperial walkers! Engage them immediately!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_47,Rebel Soldier:  Our shield is down!  Attack!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_48,Stormtrooper:  There they are.  Blast 'em!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_49,Stormtrooper:  The communication array is destroyed, Lord Vader.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_50,Stormtrooper: The power generator is down.  Finish the rest of the Rebels.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_51,Stormtrooper: These tanks should make short work of their base.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_52,Imperial Officer: We're landing reinforcements, stand by.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_53,Darth Vader: Your incompetence is troubling.  The Rebels were clearly alerted to our presence.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_54,Imperial Officer: My Lord, it is likely the traitor we are hunting may have... (choke)
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_55,Darth Vader: You've failed me for the last time, Commander.  I will be better off without your services.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_56,Stormtrooper: Lord Vader has retreated! Fall back!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_57,Emperor: I expect more from my apprentice, Lord Vader.  This pitiful Rebellion should be no match for a Sith.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_58,Darth Vader: I must see to this task personally.  Thyferra cannot be lost to the Rebellion.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_59,Hint: Use Boba Fett's Seismic Charge to destroy entire groups of enemy fighters.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_60,Rebel Soldier: It's Vader! Run for your lives!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_61,Rebel Soldier: That's Darth Vader! Let's get out of here!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_62,Rebel Soldier: Blasters are no match for a lightsaber! Find some cover!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_71,Darth Vader: Here is the power generator.  Attack it at once.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_72,Darth Vader: Fondor has been subjugated.  Have you intercepted any information about our traitor?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT01_MISSION_TWO_73,Imperial Officer:  The communication array is destroyed, Lord Vader.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_05,Stormtrooper: We've lost a prison facility!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_06,Stormtrooper: If we lose one more prison, we will not be able to maintain control on Kashyyyk!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_07,Stormtrooper: We've lost too many prison facilities - we must withdraw!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_08,Tarkin: I cannot understand how a former Imperial would waste such effort on a primitive and inferior race.  The slaves we lost were inconsequential since we still control their homeworld.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_09,Boba Fett: This Solo could be more trouble than you think.  Should I consider him my next target?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_11,Stormtrooper: Don't allow the prison facilities to be destroyed - if the Wookiees get weapons the revolt will be much more difficult to quell.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_12,Han Solo: It looks like I'm not the only one who thinks the Wookiees deserve better.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_13,Han Solo: One down, three to go.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_14,Han Solo: That's two.  I thought the Empire was supposed to be tough.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_15,Stormtrooper: The traitor Solo was wounded, but he escaped into the trees.  He won't get far.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_16,Imperial Officer: Locate him if you can.  We must make an example of him.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_17,Darth Vader: We have more important matters, bounty hunter.  Only someone with authority could have allowed the Rebels to land without detection.  The traitor may be more important than we originally thought.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_18,Imperial Officer: How did the Rebels slip past our blockade?  We're being outmaneuvered, signal the retreat!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_19,Tarkin: Your inability to compensate for changes on the battlefield makes you an ineffective commander.  Consider yourself on probation until this matter is resolved.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FIVE_20,Imperial Officer: Incoming Rebel units!  How did they get here?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_05,Imperial Officer: This world is now under the control of the Empire.  You will submit to the will of the Emperor!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_06,Imperial Officer: This world is now under the control of the Empire.  You will submit to the will of the Emperor!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_07,Imperial Officer: We have crushed your defenses.  You are helpless.  Inform your citizens that the Empire has taken control of your world!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_08,Tarkin: These creatures are quite resourceful.  Keep one for me - I could use a new servant.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_09,Imperial Officer: Sir, we have been informed by our outpost on Kashyyyk that a former Imperial Officer is inciting the Wookiees to riot.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_10,Tarkin: See to it that the situation is dealt with.  The Death Star requires additional labor and each of these brutes is worth two of anything else.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_11,Imperial Officer: Yes, sir!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_12,Imperial Officer: All hands!  A Mon Calamari capital ship has entered the area.  Be prepared for heavy fire!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_13,Han Solo: C'mon - what are you waiting for, an invitation?  Get some weapons and secure those reinforcement points!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_14,Darth Vader: I am finished with your task, so now I must continue my search for the elusive traitor.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_15,Tarkin: There is very little this informant could do to lessen the might of the Empire.  The subjugation of the Geonosians will surely send a clear message to all those who would consider opposing us.  The Rebellion won't be so bold again.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_16,Emperor: The Rebel's strength will continue to grow as long as they continue to acquire allies.  To that end, the potential firepower of the Mon Calamari fleet far exceeds that of the Rebels, and it would be a detriment if they joined forces.  We must insure this does not occur.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_17,Emperor: This uprising on Kashyyyk must be dealt with as efficiently as the Mon Calamari revolt.  Eliminate all who show opposition.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_18,Imperial Officer: The Mon Calamari defenses are too great - signal the retreat! I'll inform Lord Vader...
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_FOUR_19,Tarkin: We are not sending a clear enough message to the Mon Calamari.  Ensure this revolt does not become a problem.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_05,Veers: Welcome to the Imperial prototype demonstration field, to witness the first full test of our new All Terrain Armored Transport.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_06,Veers: As you can clearly see, the AT-AT is specifically built for difficult terrain.  Note the four-legged design is able to trample defensive barriers with ease!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_07,Veers: The sheer weight of this assault transport is formidable - watch it crush our feeble enemies under his foot!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_08,Hint: Crush lighter vehicles and infantry with the AT-AT by walking over them.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_09,Veers: Now, observe the destructive firepower of the AT-AT.  Just a few volleys at the targets will do.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_10,Hint: Use the AT-AT's Maximum Firepower special ability to destroy targets faster.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_12,Emperor: Tarkin, what do you have to report?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_13,Tarkin: The Death Star is proceeding ahead of schedule your majesty, thanks to the new labor forces from Geonosis and Kashyyyk.  We have directed the surplus in supplies to various technological advances.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_14,Emperor: I am pleased with your progress.  I have been informed of Colonel Veers and his new weapon of war.  I shall be watching the demonstration remotely - it should prove most interesting... both you and Lord Vader should view it as well.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_15,Tarkin: Colonel Veers is of the opinion that the Rebel base that launched the attack could not be far away based on the size of their force.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_16,Darth Vader: I have used his information to pinpoint Jabiim as the likely origin point.  Allow me to take a force there and crush them once and for all!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_17,Emperor: More important than destroying their worthless base of operations is finding the identity of the one who revealed the location of this demonstration, my apprentice.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_19,DO NOT USE THIS LINE
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_20,Veers: The AT-AT can handle ground troops in a variety of ways - observe as I deploy stormtroopers from the belly of the beast!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_22,Veers: Special thanks to the Imperial Prison System for providing our gracious test subjects today.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_23,Veers: Even the formidable Rancor is no match for the AT-AT!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_25,Veers: What's this?  It looks like Rebel soldiers are invading.  Not to worry.  They pose no threat to the AT-AT.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_26,Announcer: DO NOT USE THIS LINE
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_27,Veers: Thank you, your highness, for watching this demonstration.  As you can see the AT-AT is clearly capable of handling even the most... surprising of situations.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_28,Stormtrooper: We've lost a bunker!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_29,Stormtrooper: We've only got one bunker left - protect it at all costs!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_32,Stormtrooper: We've received the general retreat signal - regroup and prepare for evacuation!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_33,Emperor: A less than impressive demonstration, Colonel Veers.  I question the need for such ineffective expenses.  Perhaps your next demonstration won't be as clumsy.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_34,Emperor: I specifically requested a demonstration from Colonel Veers.  Ensure he is present.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_36,Darth Vader: I am needed elsewhere, my master.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_37,Tarkin: And with the Death Star soon fully operational, we will have no need for ground assaults in the future.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_38,Emperor: Both of you will witness this demonstration.  I see it as a seminal moment for the Empire.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_39,Emperor: Excellent work, Colonel.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_40,Emperor: Most impressive.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_41,Emperor: That is a weapon truly worthy of the Imperial army.  Good work, Colonel.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_42,Tarkin: I still don't believe we'll need such a machine once the Death Star has been unleashed upon the unsuspecting galaxy.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_43,Darth Vader: We will trace the traitor from his base and he will be my next target, my master.  He will not escape me.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_45,Emperor: I foresee Veers' new weapon being even more successful than you could imagine, Tarkin.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_46,Imperial Officer: The prototype has been destroyed!  Evacuate immediately!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_04,Imperial Officer: Sir, we're having trouble apprehending Moff Kalast.  His Star Destroyer is one of the newer models, and we've been unable to successfully engage him before he enters hyperspace.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_05,Tarkin: Indeed.  This seems to be an excellent time to test our newest weapon.  I will see to it that an Interdictor Cruiser is placed at your disposal on Coruscant.  We shall see how elusive his Star Destroyer is....
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_06,Emperor: Moff Kalast was most forthcoming... just before the end.  It seems, Tarkin, that the Bothans have chosen a side in this conflict.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_07,Tarkin: What would you have me do, your majesty?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_08,Emperor: Nothing.  Continue with the Death Star.  I will take care of this personally....  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_09,Tarkin: Obviously you underestimate the cost to produce Interdictors!  I will give you another chance, but the next one you lose will not be replaced so easily.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_10,DO NOT USE THIS LINE
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_11,Tarkin: Moff Kalast, you have been ordered to stand down.  Surrender your vessel immediately or face the consequences.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_12,Emperor: I look forward speaking with this traitor myself.  Excellent work, Lord Vader.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_13,Imperial Officer: We have received word that the traitor has been spotted.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_14,Imperial Officer: We have engaged Kalast, but he managed to escape to hyperspace.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_15,Imperial Officer: The traitor has jumped out of the system.  We will continue to monitor all channels for word of his whereabouts.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_18,Imperial Officer: Signal the full retreat!  Prepare for hyperspace!  We must (static)
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_19,Tarkin: Moff Kalast has proven elusive.  Still, even the most grand tacticians have their weaknesses.  Ensure he is held accountable for these crimes!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_20,Kalast: You'll have to catch me first.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_21,Tarkin: The length of time it took you to find him may have left my battle station at risk, Lord Vader.  I may need you to secure it for me now that you have finished the Emperor's bidding.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_04,Bothan: Welcome to Bothawui your majesty!  To what to we owe this great honor?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_05,Emperor: Your disloyalty to the Empire!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_06,Emperor: You have earned the wrath of the Empire.  Do not betray us again, or the cost will be even greater next time.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_07,Tarkin: Lord Vader, I have need of your skills once again.  Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan is due to receive a transmission from Rebel agents concerning the Death Star.  I have already sent an Interdictor fleet to the area to aid you.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_08,Darth Vader: What would you have me do with the Princess?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_09,Tarkin: I believe a thorough interrogation is in order, after which the Rebellion will be destroyed once and for all.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_10,Darth Vader: I will leave at once.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_11,Imperial Officer: I'm not receiving a signal from the Emperor's shuttle! Something must have gone wrong - order the evacuation!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_12,Darth Vader: Master, I sense you are wounded.  Let me handle the Bothawui matter in your stead.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_13,Emperor: A gracious but unnecessary gesture, Vader.  As you well know, matters of disloyalty must be tended to personally.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_14,Emperor: You underestimate the power of the dark side.  How foolish of you to think I cannot handle this matter alone!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_04,Darth Vader: Report on your findings.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_05,Stormtrooper: We found indications that the Rebels have had access to a great deal of coded Imperial data, some of it is very recent and highly classified.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_06,Darth Vader: Are you certain?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_07,Stormtrooper: They managed to destroy most of the data before we could secure it, but we've found a few files that reference the Death Star.  We're unsure just how much they know about it.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_08,Darth Vader: This traitor in our midst is more powerful than we thought to have this kind of access.  Continue your search.  This Rebel sympathizer is running out of places to hide.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_09,Stormtrooper: Yes, sir!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_10,Darth Vader: Master, I am concerned that these Rebels know too much about the Death Star.  We have uncovered evidence which reveals it is Moff Kalast who has betrayed your trust.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_11,Emperor: Not even someone of his rank could learn the full capabilities of the Death Star.  I have made sure that the schematics have been split into sections.  None of our bases ever has more than one segment at a time.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_12,Tarkin: You worry too much Lord Vader.  The only thing that the Rebels will learn is that they have no hope against the might of the Death Star.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_13,Emperor: We shall see if your faith is well placed once it has been tested Tarkin.  In the meantime, see to it that no more classified information is handed to the Rebels.  Bring this Moff Kalast to me.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_14,Imperial Officer: We're getting some strange energy readings from the planet surface.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_15,Tarkin: What kind of readings?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_16,Tarkin: Ion cannons!  Keep your distance from the planet!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_17,Imperial Officer: A Mon Calamari ship has entered system space!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_18,Imperial Officer: We have the element of surprise.  Destroy the Rebels and then secure their databanks.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_19,Captain Antilles: DO NOT USE THIS LINE
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_20,Emperor: Perhaps I have overestimated your capability.  Like an open wound, the Rebels at Jabiim inspire hope with their short-lived victory.  Correct your error, or I shall find your replacement!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_04,Imperial Officer: A Rebel fleet has just arrived from hyperspace, my Lord!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_05,Darth Vader: It is a useless gesture.  They cannot prevent the end of Alderaan!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_07,Tarkin: She lied to us!  The remains of a Rebel base at Dantooine had been abandoned for some time.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_08,Darth Vader: No matter.  Any further resistance will soon be crushed.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_09,Tarkin: What of the Princess and her collaborators?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_10,Darth Vader: They have been allowed to escape.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_11,Tarkin: You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader, this had better work.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_12,Darth Vader: Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable; it will be some time before we can extract any information from her.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_13,Tarkin: Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion....
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_14,Darth Vader: What do you mean?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_15,Tarkin: I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station.  Set your course for Alderaan.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_17,Imperial Officer: The Rebels have broken through! Inform the Death Star, we are unable to interrupt their defenses!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_18,Tarkin: A mere setback, yet completely avoidable.  Have the fleet commander report to me directly for dismissal.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_19,Tarkin: And how might I ask would one effectively demonstrate the firepower of the Death Star without it being present?  Set its course for Alderaan immediately!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_04,Imperial Officer: Lord Vader, request immediate assistance! Pirate raider party engaged, taking casualties!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_05,Darth Vader: Witness the awful vengeance of the Empire against its enemies, Commander! 
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_06,Imperial Officer: That's all of them.  Thank you for the assistance.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_07,Imperial Officer: We're picking up Rebel transmissions from a nearby sector.  They should be within range within moments.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_08,Darth Vader: Move the fleet into the nebulas to avoid detection.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_09,Blue Leader: All clear!  Stand by to receive transmission
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_10,Darth Vader: Now!  Capture her quickly!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_11,Rebel Captain: Sector's clear.  We have go for jump window.  Repeat.  We have go for jump window.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_12,Imperial Officer: The princess has jumped to hyperspace!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_13,Darth Vader: You fools!  I said capture her, not destroy her!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_14,Imperial Officer: The ship has been neutralized.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_15,Darth Vader: Your diplomatic immunity is worthless now, Rebel.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_16,Blue Leader: Imperial forces detected!  Abort mission!  Abort!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_17,Rebel Captain: Jump complete.  Begin the sweep, and stay alert!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_18,Darth Vader: Wait until the Princess acknowledges the transmission before moving on them....
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_19,Captain Antilles: Imperial forces, we are on a diplomatic mission.  You have no authority here to detain us.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_20,Imperial Officer: We've detected a burst transmission to the Princess' ship, and a confirmation tag.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_21,Blue Leader: Imperial forces!  It's a trap!  Get the Princess out of here!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_22,Darth Vader: Bring the Interdictors on-line to block the Rebels' escape!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_23,Darth Vader: The Death Star plans were not found in the Rebel ship's memory banks.  We are searching the nearby systems.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_24,Tarkin: It's of no consequence.  The Death Star has been completed and is ready for testing.  Once we persuade her to reveal the Rebels' location, we will test this station on their hidden base.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_25,Darth Vader: Those Interdictors must be protected.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_26,Imperial Officer: All Interdictors have been destroyed, Lord Vader.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_27,Darth Vader: You have failed me for the last time, commander.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_28,Imperial Officer: We've lost one of our Interdictors!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_29,Imperial Officer: There's only one Intedictor left.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_30,Darth Vader: Long-range scanners have picked up a Rebel scouting party.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_31,Darth Vader: Hold your fire until the Princess receives the transmissions.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_32,Blue Leader: This is Blue Squadron initiating sector sweep.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_33,Captain Antilles: Roger that, Blue Leader, standing by.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_34,Blue Leader: It's quiet...too quiet.  Didn't intel report a heavy pirate presence here?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_35,Blue Leader: Base, this is Blue Leader, Tatooine space is clear.  We are go for jump.  Repeat, we are go for jump.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_36,Darth Vader: Clear the sector of all pirates, they must not interfere with our plans.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_37,Darth Vader: Time is running out, destroy all the pirates!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_38,Darth Vader: The Princess must be kept alive.  Use the Star Destroyer's Tractor Beam to capture her ship.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_39,Captain Antilles: The Imperial forces are retreating!  Concentrate your fire on their remaining vessels!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_40,Tarkin: I am surprised, Lord Vader.  Beaten by the Princess and her entourage!  No matter, she will not escape us next time.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_41,Darth Vader: Fool!  The capture of the Princess has been entrusted to me!  Requisition a Star Destroyer, we will use the Tractor Beam to subdue her.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_03,Emperor: Lord Vader, I have a final task for you....
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_04,Darth Vader: What is thy bidding my master?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_05,Emperor: I have sensed that this Rebellion is seeking, in its final desperate hours, to attack the Death Star.  They have managed to consolidate their forces on five worlds.  Destroy them.  All of them!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_06,Darth Vader: It shall be done.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_07,Tarkin: What of the Death Star, your majesty?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_08,Emperor: Use it's full destructive power against them!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_09,Imperial Officer: Sir, I've analyzed their attack and there is a danger.  Shall I have your shuttle standing by?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_10,Tarkin: Evacuate?  In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_11,Imperial Officer: Yes, sir....
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_12,Imperial Officer: The Rebels have destroyed the Death Star!  Contact Lord Vader immediately!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_13,Imperial Officer: DO NOT USE THIS LINE
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_14,Darth Vader: Regroup with the others.  My master will know how to proceed.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_15,Darth Vader: The Force was strong with him.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_16,Darth Vader: The Force was strong with that one.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_17,Stormtrooper: The planet has been destroyed, sir.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_18,Darth Vader: Impressive.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_19,Tarkin: Was there ever any doubt?
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_20,Emperor: Yes!  I can feel their pain....
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_21,Emperor: Now that they have nowhere else to run, the Rebel leaders have fled to Yavin.  Ensure there are no survivors, Tarkin.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_22,Tarkin: It will be my pleasure, your majesty.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_24,Imperial Officer: Yavin had been destroyed, my Lord.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_25,Emperor: All our efforts will have been in vain if the Death Star is used so ineffectively.  It takes a ruthless warrior to wield such a powerful weapon.  Do not fail me again!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_26,Tarkin: I believe the Emperor specifically requested the use of the Death Star.  What a waste, to build such a grand weapon and let it languish!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_27,Vader: You are gaining the Emperor's attention.  He has rewarded you for your recent accomplishments.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_28,Vader: Imperial resources are being redirected to those who know how to use them.  Do not squander this generous gift from the Emperor.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_29,Vader: My master is pleased with your expected victory, and has assigned you additional Imperial assets.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_30,Vader: This victory brings us ever closer to crushing the Rebellion for good.  These supplies will further your efforts for the Empire.  
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_31,Tarkin: It seems our offensive is proceeding according to plan.  Soon, the Rebellion will be no more.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_32,Emperor: I sense their end is indeed at hand.  Ensure you use the Death Star effectively, to avoid any unnecessary ground conflict.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_33,Tarkin: It shall be done, your highness.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_34,Tarkin: I find it amusing to see such courage in the face of inevitability.  The Rebels throw themselves at the fire so willingly.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_35,Emperor: Their faith in their leaders is strong, Tarkin.  Unfortunately, faith alone will not be enough to save them from the might of the Death Star.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_36,Tarkin: As you can see, Lord Vader, our efforts were not in vain.  Like a cornered animal, the Rebellion panics in its last gasps for survival.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_37,Darth Vader: Do not celebrate victory prematurely, Tarkin.  Cornered animals are known for their ferocity.  We must show them no mercy!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_38,Darth Vader: Master, the Rebellion has been reduced to a mere pocket of resistance.  Complete control of the galaxy is at hand.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_39,Emperor: It is as I have foreseen, my apprentice.  Our years of toil are finally coming to an end.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_INVALID_ACTION,Imperial Officer: You're not authorized to do that!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_SPACE_WIN_01,Emperor Palpatine: Rise, my friend.  This day has seen the end of the last Jedi Knight, and the Rebellion.
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_SPACE_WIN_02,Darth Vader: There is nothing to stop us now, my master!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_SPACE_WIN_03,Emperor Palpatine: It is all as I have foreseen!
TEXT_SPEECH_EMPIRE_SPACE_WIN_04,Emperor Palpatine: [Evil Cackling]
TEXT_SPEECH_ENDOR_BND_VICTORY_COR18_01,Defiler: I've successfully set up a series of slave pits to transform the little captured Ewoks into exploding slave units.
TEXT_SPEECH_ERIADU_BLK_VICTORY_COR19_02,Defiler: The already established Eriadu black market, which we now control, is bringing technology to the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_ERIADU_RKT_VICTORY_COR19_01,Defiler: Systems have been set up on the orbital habitats.  We'll now attempt to lure enemies to the system in order to destroy their ships, and then claim them as salvage.
TEXT_SPEECH_FELUCIA_BRB_VICTORY_COR20_01,Defiler: The Commerce Guild associates are now in the Zann Consortium pockets.  Long live Tyber Zann!
TEXT_SPEECH_FELUCIA_RKT_VICTORY_COR20_02,Defiler: Racketeering is spreading surprisingly fast on the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_00,Tyber Zann: Take this Saboteur, corrupt Nal Hutta, and then report back to me.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_00B,Tyber Zann: Take this Saboteur, corrupt Kashyyyk, and then report back to me.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_01,Hint: Drag the saboteur to the 'Spread Corruption' slot on Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_01B,Hint: Drag the saboteur to the 'Spread Corruption' slot on Kashyyyk.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_02,Tyber Zann: Good!  Our influence has been spread to Kashyyyk.  As long as Kashyyyk remains corrupted we can access the Black Market that is in place on that planet.  Now, direct my lieutenant to purchase Stealth Technology from the Black Market on Kashyyyk.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_03,Hint: Drag Silri to the 'Buy' slot on Kashyyyk and choose Cloaking Technology from the purchase menu.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_04,Tyber Zann: Kashyyyk is crawling with Imperial units, so we will need to find another target if we're going to expand our operations.  Capturing Felucia would allow us to build a larger army.  Take this Saboteur to Felucia, and spread our corruption influence on that planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_05,Tyber Zann: As you might have already guessed - they're called Saboteurs for a reason.  Move this Saboteur to Felucia, and destroy the Ion Cannon that the Rebels have built.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_06,Hint: Drag the saboteur to the 'Sabotage' slot on Felucia and destroy the Ion Cannon.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_07,Tyber Zann: Felucia is our goal, but we do not want to draw the attention of the Empire... yet.  We will bribe our way past Kashyyyk, and attack the Rebels at Felucia.  Combine all of our space forces at Nal Hutta, and move them to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_08,Hint: To see the cost to bribe your way to a planet, drag your force to your final destination without letting go of the mouse button.  The bribe cost will be listed next to your fleet.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_09,Hint: Include Tyber in the invading space fleet and bring all of our space units from Nal Hutta to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_10,Tyber Zann: Now that we have secured the space above Felucia, we can use our land forces to conquer the planet.  Bring all of our land units from Nal Hutta to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_11,Hint: Bring all of our land units from Nal Hutta to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_12,Tyber Zann: Remember to use the abilities of our heroes to gain an upper hand in this battle.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_13,Tyber Zann: Excellent.  We can now use Felucia to produce advanced ships.  I will leave it to you to capture the remaining planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_14,Hint: Use the saboteur to spread corruption to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_15,Hint: Conquer the remaining planets in the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_16,Tyber Zann: Our Mercenaries are equipped with disruptor technology from the Black Market.  Switch to these weapons when fighting enemy infantry.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_17,Tyber Zann: Make sure you include Tyber in the invading fleet!
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_18,Tyber Zann: Their forces are too powerful; we can't take them on just yet.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_19,Tyber Zann: A bunker!  We can use these structures to protect our infantry, and to hold key areas of the battlefield.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_20,Tyber Zann: This terrain is far too dense for vehicles, but infantry will have no problems traveling through this area.  Let's use this to our advantage.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_21,Tyber Zann: Since we have Destroyers in orbit, we can order an orbital bombardment.   This Rebel base would be an ideal target for this new weapon.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_22,Tyber Zann: This would be an ideal time to use the cloaking technology that we purchased on the Black Market.  Use this ability on our Vengeance-Class ships to launch a sneak attack on the nearby Rebel turrets.  They'll never know what hit them.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_23,Tyber Zann: The enemy has bomber units, but we did not come unprepared.  We can easily counter these pests by using the defensive systems on our new Crusader Gunships.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_24,Tyber Zann: We are not bound by the same restrictions that plague our enemies.  There will be no Imperial bureaucracy to slow us down; and we do not follow a righteous moral code as the Rebels do.  NOTHING will stand in the way of our success.  We will corrupt, sabotage, and then annihilate our enemies.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_25,Tyber Zann: We need money!  We must spread corruption to nearby planets with our Saboteurs.  Once it has been established, our corruption influence will automatically begin extorting a percentage of the planetary income.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_26,Tyber Zann: Zoom in 2X on corrupted planets to see the positions of enemy structures and forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_27,Tyber Zann: Ah, very nice...  Imperial cloaking technology.  It would have been a steal at twice that price!
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_28,Tyber Zann: Whenever an enemy planet has been corrupted we can spy on the activity on that planet. In this case, it appears that the Rebel Alliance is defending Felucia with an Ion Cannon. I hate surprises...
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_29,Tyber Zann: Everyone has a price... use my Bribery ability to sway enemy units to our cause.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_30,Tyber Zann: Unlike the Rebel and Empire, these asteroids pose no threat to our ships.  We can use this ability as part of our tactics, to hide or evade the enemy
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_31,Tyber Zann: This Rebel space station is heavily shielded, but our Kedalbe ship has the ability to drain enemy's shields.  Let's use their own shields against them!
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_32,Hint: You can zoom in 2X to configure all of your bases to your liking.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_33,Tyber Zann: Since this planet has been corrupted by our influence, we will receive a bounty for every enemy that we kill.  Apparently, crime does pay.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_34,Tyber Zann: Thanks to our advanced recon we have been able to pin point the location of the rebel power generator. Unfortunately it lies within an area traversable only by infantry.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_35,Tyber Zann: Destroying the power generator will render the Rebel base shield useless and allow us to launch an assault on their base.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_36,Hint: As long as their base shield is active our planetary bombardment is useless against their factories.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_37,Hint: A Saboteur spreads the will of Tyber Zann across the galaxy by infiltrating and corrupting a planet using bribery, extortion, and assassination.  This takes time to complete and the percentage of corruption will build up until a planet is completely corrupted.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_38,Hint: From this Advanced Base Layout screen, the owner of the planet can arrange any troops and base structures to better defend it.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_39,Hint: Technology purchased from the black market will vary depending on which faction currently owns the planet.  The cost to steal a certain technology will vary depending on the current tech level of the enemy that you are stealing from.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_40,Hint: The cost to destroy each structure is displayed next to it. For our purposes, the Ion Cannon is the only structure that is affordable to sabotage.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_41,Tyber Zann: Direct these mercenaries to enter the bunker by selecting them and clicking on the bunker.  This will garrison them inside the bunker and protect them from any damage, while allowing them to fire upon any nearby enemies.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_42,Hint: To call down reinforcements, click the Call for Reinforcements button.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_43,Hint: Now drag the F9-TZ Transport company from the reinforcement window to your reinforcement point on the land map.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_44,Tyber Zann: Now that those pests have been taken care of, we need to take out that shield generator.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_45,Hint: Load your units into the troop transport by selecting them and clicking on the transport unit, then move the transport to the designated area.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_46,Hint: Some areas are impassable to vehicles and can only be reached by infantry.  Eject your troops and send them to the shield generator.
TEXT_SPEECH_FOCUS_DEMO_47,Tyber Zann: Now that our way is clear, take our forces and destroy the enemy's base. 
TEXT_SPEECH_FONDOR_CRM_VICTORY_COR21_05,Defiler: The highly valuable indigenous units of Fondor are now ours to use as we see fit.
TEXT_SPEECH_FONDOR_PIR_LOAD_COR21_01,Bossk: I'll not be denied.  Move your ships into place!
TEXT_SPEECH_FONDOR_PIR_LOSS_COR21_04,Bossk: Now I want to go back into the fight and finish the job I started.
TEXT_SPEECH_FONDOR_PIR_OBJECTIVE_02,Destroy the enemy space station.
TEXT_SPEECH_FONDOR_PIR_TACTICAL_COR21_02,Bossk: The Fondor space stations are extremely powerful.  We must maneuver our forces to destroy one completely.
TEXT_SPEECH_FONDOR_PIR_VICTORY_COR21_03,Bossk: My forces have succeeded where others would have failed.  A bit more of the Empire is lost to their use.
TEXT_SPEECH_FRESIA_BRB_VICTORY_COR22_01,Defiler: The Incom Corporation has proven cooperative.  The Consortium expands greatly with this acquisition.
TEXT_SPEECH_FRESIA_CRM_VICTORY_COR22_02,Defiler: We've gained another powerful piece of military hardware.  The Consortium grows even stronger!
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_01,Bossk: There's our target!  Move in!
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_02,IG-88: Target located!  Proceed!
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_03,Silri: Our prey has been revealed!  Strike now!
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_04,Tyber Zann: There's our target.  Execute the plan.
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_05,Urai Fen: Our target presents itself.  Concentrate there.
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_06,Consortium Soldier: There's our target!  Move in!
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_07,Defiler: I can't corrupt that system.
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_08,Defiler: I am unable to spread corruption there.
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_09,Defiler: Corruption won't work there.
TEXT_SPEECH_GENERIC_COR60_10,Defiler: That system can't be corrupted.
TEXT_SPEECH_GEONOSIS_BND_VICTORY_COR23_02,Defiler: Enslaving this planet's people will have a major effect on the makeup of Imperial troop deployments.
TEXT_SPEECH_GEONOSIS_CRM_VICTORY_COR23_01,Defiler: We have discovered the manufacture points of droids on the planet, and new force pools are in transit to Zann forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_00,Rebels are blatantly making their presence known in the streets!  Deploying some troops on the surface should remove any traitorous thoughts from their heads.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_01,There can be no diplomacy with Rebels!  Deploy some troops and show them how we negotiate!
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_02,This planet is at risk of falling into the hands of the Rebellion!  Mount a defense that will send them crawling back into their holes.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_03,Removing their land bases in the area would go a long way in helping us keep the Rebellion out of our space.  See to it.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_04,We have found the Rebel leader Mon Mothma.   Go now and remove the plague that has infested the Empire once and for all!
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_ATTACK_E_05,This last bastion of Rebel hope will quickly fade once we have eliminated their final base of operation.   Go now and do the Emperor's bidding.   Our  complete victory is at hand!
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_00,Our intelligence officers have discovered that a hostile fleet has evaded our orbital defenses and are landing their forces.  I need you to scout the area and find a weakness.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_01,The best defense is a good offense.  Go out and capture all the landing locations.  The enemy will be unable to send in reinforcements and will fall to our greater numbers.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_02,Rebel cells are showing their faces across the galaxy.  We can't allow them to burrow into the Empire like worms.  Show them that their aggressions against the Empire will not be tolerated.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_03,The ground bases are the backbone of our defenses.  We need to increase their number if we are to teach the Rebellion that their cause is a losing proposition.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_04,A small force of Rebels has infiltrated our outer defenses and landed somewhere on the planet surface.  Seek out and remove them immediately.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_LAND_DEFEND_E_05,Remove the Rebel presence from the surface of the planet immediately!   We must take every precaution to ensure that the Emperor is not harmed.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_E_00,These vagrants stand in our way.  Eliminate them to prepare for our land invasion.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_E_01,This pitiful force is preventing our assault on this system.  Dispatch them so that we can secure orbit for the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_E_02,Sensors are reporting that there is a hostile presence surrounding the planet.  Lay waste to any forces that oppose the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_E_03,Let's show these dissidents who rules this galaxy. Remove their influence from this system by destroying all their defenses.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_ATTACK_E_04,This is a momentous occasion for the Empire!   Bring the Death Star in range of the planet and show this pitiful insurgency the true power of this fully functional battle station!
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_E_00,You've let unidentified ships slip through our perimeter! Send a fleet to investigate.
TEXT_SPEECH_GES_INTRO_SPACE_DEFEND_E_01,Our sensors are reporting that a fleet is incoming.  Show them how we deal with traitors.

TEXT_SPEECH_HONOGHR_INT_LOAD_COR25_01,Urai Fen: We move as quickly otherwise our forces will be overwhelmed by Noghri assassins. I have heard boastful rumors of their battle skills, so this should be a good challenge.
TEXT_SPEECH_HONOGHR_INT_LOSS_COR25_05,Urai Fen: We tried our best, but their forces were just too much...
TEXT_SPEECH_HONOGHR_INT_TACTICAL_COR25_02,Urai Fen: What the Noghri assassins of Honoghr lack in numbers, they make up for in skill.  If we can destroy three of their base camp structures, it will send a strong message.
TEXT_SPEECH_HONOGHR_INT_VICTORY_COR25_04,Urai Fen: Even Vader's assassins proved no match for our forces.  This victory ensures that word of the Zann Consortium spreads quickly!
TEXT_SPEECH_HONOGHR_RKT_VICTORY_COR25_06,Defiler: Rigged games of chance and fixed bouts of combat should bring credits to our organization.  Once the galaxy sees the defeat of the Noghri at our hands, fewer will stand in our way.

TEXT_SPEECH_KESSEL_PIR_VICTORY_COR30_03,IG-88: We have succeeded beyond my calculations.  We have added a new ship to our fleet.  We are redirecting enemy credits into our own coffers.  Already, we have heard reports of transport ships mysteriously disappearing as a result of our taking over control of the communication satellite.
TEXT_SPEECH_KORRIBAN_RKT_VICTORY_COR31_01,Defiler: While I've been successful in setting up our organization here, we should be wary; there is dark Force energy in this sector of space...

TEXT_SPEECH_KUAT_KID_VICTORY_COR32_03,Bossk: With Bevel Lemelisk in our control, constant sums of credits flow into Consortium accounts.  Especially from our vantage point in Kuat.  We should be able to broadcast our actions to other systems making our bribery efforts increasingly successful.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANAAN_RKT_VICTORY_COR33_01,Defiler: As expected, we've set up our organization on-planet.  They're even starting to pay their debts in kolto.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_BRB_VICTORY_COR34_08,Defiler: I've successfully bribed the warrior clan leader on Mandalore.  Mandalorian mercenary forces will now fight only for Zann.  They've also agreed to track our enemies movements through their system.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_DIALOG_COR34_10,Tyber Zann: Captain, you would have made a good Consortium leader, too bad you have to die. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_DIALOG_COR34_11,Tyber Zann: You fight bravely, but not wisely. Your time ends now. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_DIALOG_COR34_12,Tyber Zann: You are brave but very foolish to challenge the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_LOAD_COR34_01,Tyber Zann: Men, expect waves of assault ships as we corrupt the planet.  The battle isn't over until we have destroyed the Kedalbe warship.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_LOSS_COR34_07,Tyber Zann: I'm surrounded by incompetence!  I give you one last time to prove yourselves.  Do not fail me again!
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_TACTICAL_COR34_03,Tyber Zann: Facing the Mandalorians will be one of our greatest challenges!  I will face their clan leader in space above the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_PIR_VICTORY_COR34_05,Tyber Zann: I've successfully corrupted Mandalore.  Victory over the Mandalorians will strike fear in all those who dare to oppose us.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_RKT_VICTORY_COR34_09,Defiler: We've set up our organization on the world and they're responding unusually well to the activities we use to draw off their credits.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_STORY_PIR_LOAD_COR34_02,Tyber Zann: Men, the Zann Consortium expects your best today. If everyone does their part we'll not fail. 
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_STORY_PIR_TACTICAL_COR34_04,Tyber Zann: We'll be facing the Mandalorian clan chieftans attempting to defend the space above their planet.  Their proud warrior tradition means this will be a fight to the death.
TEXT_SPEECH_MANDALORE_STORY_PIR_VICTORY_COR34_06,Tyber Zann: I've successfully defeated the Mandalorian Chieftain!  The continuing raids will soon bring them to their knees!

TEXT_SPEECH_MONCALAMARI_PIR_TACTICAL_COR35_02,IG-88: There are two large space stations working on starship engines.  We must destroy them and sift through the ruins for engineering data.
TEXT_SPEECH_MONCALAMARI_PIR_VICTORY_COR35_03,IG-88: We're successful, and more ship building secrets will come out of corrupting this system.
TEXT_SPEECH_MUSTAFAR_BRB_VICTORY_COR36_01,Defiler: As expected we have successfully bribed the Techno Union officials.  Droids from this world will no longer be manufactured to aid our enemies in this sector.

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_23,C-3PO: Excuse me sir, but I believe Artoo could get the codes from the Imperial station uplink on Wayland to register your ships.  Then the Fresian sentries would clear you to the surface.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_ONE_24,Antilles: Not a bad plan, Threepio.  But you droids will never get there on your own.  You'll need a sizeable escort of ground troops to have any chance at all.

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_22,Antilles: We have to abort - we lost all the pilots!  Retreat now!

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_30,Mon Mothma: I'm afraid we can't do that.  If the Alliance is to survive, we must choose our targets wisely.  That way we have a chance of clearing the Imperial oppression from all the systems, not just Fresia.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT01_MISSION_THREE_31,Antilles: We should strike back immediately!  We can show the Fresians they are not alone.

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_20,Han Solo: Chewie, he's not here!  Are you sure that Bothan gave you the right location?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_21,Han Solo: He's not here either!  I can't believe you made us come this far on just a rumor!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_22,Han Solo: I don't think we're looking in the right camp!  Don't worry, buddy, I'm not giving up yet!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_23,Han Solo: Chewie, he's just not here.  I'm sorry, pal, but we've run out of prisons to check.  We gotta keep looking though.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_24,Mon Mothma: Our mission is not yet complete.  If we retreat now, we will have failed to help the Wookiees in their time of need.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_25,Mon Mothma: The Wookiee tree houses have been decimated.  They can no longer fight back against the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_26,Mon Mothma: With Han Solo defeated, you will have to take the prisons by force.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_27,Task: Free the Wookiees from the remaining prisons by destroying them.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_28,Mon Mothma: I cannot believe that a smuggler would put himself at such great risk to help the Wookiees.  You are truly a hero.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_29,Han Solo: You can spare me the flattery.  I didn't do that for your Rebellion or your gratitude.  I've got bills to pay.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_30,Mon Mothma: The Alliance is always in need of help, remember that if you ever find yourself out of work.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT02_MISSION_SIX_31,Han Solo: Sorry, but I've got my own problems to worry about.  If you have a job for me - one that pays - feel free to look me up.  Until then, I'll stick with causes that are more... lucrative.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_03,Mon Mothma: We must get that EMP device into the right container!  Make sure Captain Solo gets back to the Vergesso Asteroids and finds that cargo!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_05,Imperial Officer: Intruder detected!  Combat patrols investigate!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_06,Han Solo: We've been spotted again!  Quick!  Take them out!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_07,Han Solo: We've been spotted by another patrol.  I hope no Star Destroyers show up.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_08,Han Solo: We've been spotted again.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_09,Han Solo: Looks like we've found it.  Why is it always in the last place we look?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_10,Han Solo: The TIE Fighter patrol has reported our presence in the system.  The Empire is scrambling ships.  We better wrap this up quick.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_14,Han Solo: ...and another thing Chewie - I tell you, the next time we run into the Imperials, I'm just going to dump the cargo and let them board us.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_15,Mon Mothma: You can do whatever you wish once you finish this task and return to your chosen career, Solo.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_16,Han Solo: Look, lady, I'm a stand up guy.  So I'll take care of this for you.  But the next time I'll expect payment in advance.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_17,Han Solo: I think I've repaid my debt.  If you don't mind, I've got better things to do that won't involve me almost getting killed.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_18,Mon Mothma: Don't go running off too far though.  You've proven yourself effective and trustworthy.  We may have a job for you soon... one that pays.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_19,Han Solo: Now you've got my attention.  I'll be around - I'm sure you know where you can find me.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_20,Antilles: We'll monitor Imperial comms.  That should lead us right to you.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_21,Han Solo: Trust me, they won't be catching me again.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_22,Han Solo: Ok, hold it here.  I'll start the scan....
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_23,Han Solo: It's not in this one.  Let's keep looking Chewie.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_24,Han Solo: Okay, we just need a minute to attach the device....
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_25,Han Solo: We're done!  Let's get out of here Chewie!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_26,Boba Fett: I'm tracking a ship that was reported in this area recently.  Anything suspicious to report?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_27,Imperial Officer: Nothing, aside from the usual pirate activity.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_28,Boba Fett: I'll take a look around just to make sure.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_29,Boba Fett: You won't escape this time!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_30,Boba Fett: Looks like you're clean.  I'll be sure to tell Darth Vader of your cooperation today.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_31,Han Solo: I thought he'd never leave.  C'mon Chewie, let's get back to business.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_32,Han Solo: I don't know who this guy thinks he is.  You got any idea pal?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_33,Imperial Officer: Intruder detected!  Combat patrols investigate!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_35,Imperial Officer: Sweep complete.  Return to base.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_36,Mon Mothma: The Millennium Falcon has been disabled.  We must abort the mission!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_37,Imperial Officer: State your business, bounty hunter.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_38,Imperial Officer: Just make it quick.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_39,Imperial Officer: I'm sure you will.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_44,Imperial Officer: Intruders in transit sector! All ships to full alert!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_45,Han Solo: Scanning initiated.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_46,Han Solo: Go ahead and scan Chewie.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_47,Han Solo: We're scanning.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_48,Han Solo: We moved to far away - we lost the scan lock.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_03,Mon Mothma: We've been tracking the cargo container, and the Empire has finally delivered it to the station at Corulag.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_04,Mon Mothma: The EMP device we've planted will be discovered soon, so time is critical.  Hurry to Corulag and detonate the device.  With the station's defenses taken offline, we can move in and raid the facility for information.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_05,Antilles: We'll recover whatever data we can find and get to the bottom of this secret weapon once and for all!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_06,Antilles: I'm going to need to be with the fleet for this one.  I won't leave a mission this important to someone else.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_07,Antilles: We have to recover that information!  As soon as we can, we must return to Corulag.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_09,Antilles: We've lost one of the boarding shuttles!  If we lose them all, no one's getting off that station!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_10,Antilles: There's only one shuttle left!  We lose it and this mission is over!  Protect it at all costs!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_11,Antilles: We've lost all the shuttles!  Abort the mission!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_12,Antilles: The Sundered Heart has taken too much damage!  I'm sorry, but I need to retreat.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_13,Rebel Pilot: Another batch of ships are recovering from the EMP effect!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_14,Rebel Pilot: We've got some more ships waking up!  Watch out!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_15,Rebel Pilot: Another group of ships have reactivated!  We've got incoming!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_16,Rebel Pilot: Most of the big ships are waking up!  We better hurry!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_17,Rebel Pilot: The turrets are coming back online!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_18,Antilles: What's the status in there?  We've got Imperial ships waking up out here!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_19,Rebel Soldier: We're completing our search of the lower level, moving up.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_20,Antilles: What's your status, soldier?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_21,Rebel Soldier: Almost done with our sweep of the mid-levels.  We've found some intel that looks promising... Stormtroopers!  Get down!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_22,Antilles: I hope you're almost done!  Things are getting rougher by the minute!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_23,Rebel Soldier: We've encountered some resistance in the upper levels.  We've found some Mon Calamari here, including one named Ackbar who works for Tarkin!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_24,Antilles: Bring them back along with anything else you find!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_25,Antilles: You had better be done soon - most of the sector is waking up!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_26,Rebel Soldier: We've completed our sweep and are returning to the lower levels. More resistance!  We'll be there as soon as we can!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_27,Rebel Soldier: Mission complete!  We're back on the shuttles and ready to get out of here!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_28,Antilles: All craft, make for the designated coordinates and get out of the system!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_30,Antilles: Everyone jump to lightspeed!  Let's get out of here while we still can!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_31,Rebel Pilot: It's like time just stopped here.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_32,Antilles: It's borrowed time at best.  When they get moving again, we better not be around.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_33,Antilles: Boarding parties, get going.  Search the station and collect any data you can!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_34,Rebel Soldier: Yes, sir!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_35,Antilles: That EMP didn't last as long as we thought!  Protect the boarding party and take out any ship that reactivates!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_36,Mon Mothma: The Mon Calamari we rescued was in Tarkin's service for some time and has a wealth of information.  The name of this Imperial superweapon is the Death Star.  We can only assume its purpose follows its name.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_37,Antilles: Any word from our other contacts?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_38,Mon Mothma: Our friend within the Senate is following her leads as we speak.  She may be able to provide us detailed schematics of the Death Star, but will need a reliable captain for some errands that may put her at risk.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_39,Antilles: I'll transfer to her ship immediately.  Threepio, Artoo, come along.  We'll need you too.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_40,C-3PO: Of course, sir.  We're glad to be of service.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_41,Mon Mothma: Do be careful, the Empire grows bolder in its liberties with the Senate each day.  They may not respect any form of diplomatic immunity in their pursuit of our destruction.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_45,Antilles: The space station has been destroyed - along with our men.  We must retreat!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_04,Mon Mothma: My inquiries into this Imperial superweapon have put us in a dangerous situation.  A pirate associate of ours has gone rogue, offering to sell information on the Alliance to Imperial command.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_05,Antilles: That's what we get for dealing with those slimeballs.  Those pirates would sell their own mothers out for a few credits!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_06,Mon Mothma: He has arranged a meeting with the Imperials near Atzerri.  We must intercept that pirate before he can transfer the detailed information of our bases to the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_07,Antilles: The Empire will not get their hands on that data!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_08,Antilles: I said I'd take care of this, and I mean to be there to do so.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_09,Antilles: The Alliance is doomed if we don't recover that data from the pirates.  As soon as my ship is repaired, we must try again!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_11,Imperial Officer: The pirate is going after our Interdictors!  Stop him!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_12,Antilles: If the pirate takes out the Interdictors, we won't be able to catch him!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_13,Imperial Officer: We've lost one of our Interdictors!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_14,Antilles: Once those Interdictors are gone, the pirate will jump to lightspeed.  We can't let that happen!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_15,Antilles: There's only one Interdictor left!  We have to stop the pirate before it's destroyed!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_16,Antilles: One more to go and we can get out of here!  Concentrate on that last Interdictor!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_17,Imperial Officer: We've lost all our Interdictors!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_18,Antilles: The pirate can escape!  We've got to stop him!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_19,Imperial Officer: Our Interdictors have been destroyed!  Stop the Rebels before they can escape!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_20,Imperial Officer: Multiple jump signatures inbound!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_21,Antilles: Looks like the pirate called for help.  Now things get interesting!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_22,Antilles: The pirate has been disabled!  Get over to his ship before the Empire can!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_23,Antilles: We've recovered the data!  Now let's get out of here!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_24,Rebel Pilot: With those Interdictors on-line, we aren't going anywhere!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_25,Antilles: Then we have to take those things down so we can get out of here!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_26,Antilles: We've got the data!  Let's get out of here before the Empire brings in more ships!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_27,Antilles: The pirate has jumped out of the system!  We've lost him!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_28,Imperial Officer: We have recovered the Rebel data!  Transmit it to Coruscant immediately!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_29,Antilles: No!  The Alliance is done for!  We should have moved faster!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_30,Antilles: The Empire is going after the pirate's ship!  We must get to it before they do!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_31,Antilles: All ships, retreat!  We've got the data and the Interdictors are down!  Let's get out of here while we can!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_32,Mon Mothma: The data the pirate carried would have been damning to the Alliance's efforts and many systems would have been in jeopardy had it fallen into the Empire's hands.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_33,Mon Mothma: The captured pirate has divulged information he's gathered on this superweapon project.  Grand Moff Tarkin is overseeing that project personally.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_34,Mon Mothma: We know where Tarkin was conducting research, but we risk a frontal assault on a fortified Imperial station.  But there may be another way, and I think I know an experienced smuggler who can assist us....
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_35,Han Solo: Well, well, if it isn't the Rebel Alliance!  Seeing as how you're all about helping people, how about lending me a hand?  I've got some unwanted Imperial attention....
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_36,Mon Mothma: We will consider it payment for future services rendered.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_37,Han Solo: Payment?  Well, I... okay, okay!  Fine!  Deal!  Just get us out of here!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_38,Antilles: Looks like we got here in time!  The Imperial fleet hasn't arrived yet!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_39,Antilles: Blast!  I spoke too soon.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_40,Imperial Officer: A Rebel fleet!  So much the better!  We will destroy them and get the data as well!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_41,Antilles: We're too late!  The pirate is heading right for the Empire's fleet!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_42,Imperial Officer: Attention pirate scum, surrender the data on the Alliance or be destroyed!  We will spare your life in return.  There will be no negotiations!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_43,Imperial Officer: The pirate is running!  Stop him!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_44,Antilles: We've got to get to that pirate before the Empire does!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_48,Antilles: I need to get close to that pirate's starship to get what we need.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_49,Pirate: You may have found me, but it will do you no good.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_50,Pirate: The Rebellion is finished. You'll never get to me before I reach the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_51,Pirate: It's going to take more than a few Rebel ships to stop me.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_52,Pirate: Just another moment and the Empire will know all of the Alliance's secrets.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_53,Pirate: Take evasive action! All auxiliary power to the deflector shields!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_54,Pirate: We're taking heavy fire! This ship won't take much more!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_55,Rebel Pilot: We've spotted an Interdictor!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_56,Rebel Pilot: I've got visual lock on an Interdictor.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_57,Antilles: Keep searching, there's still more Interdictors in this sector.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_58,Antilles: Continue scanning. We have more Interdictors to deal with.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_03,Mon Mothma: The loss of Captain Solo is unfortunate.  We must try again to rescue him from the Empire.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_04,Imperial Officer: Smuggler scum!  We've got you now!  Prepare to be boarded!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_05,Han Solo: Now or never guys!  Get us out of here!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_07,Han Solo: Sooner than later fellas!  This ship isn't indestructible!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_08,Han Solo: That did it!  Now let's get out of here while we're still in one piece!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_11,Han Solo: So about that payment in advance thing....
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_12,Mon Mothma: We have a mission for you, Captain Solo.  Something that I feel is perfectly suited for someone with your particular... skills.  We have an errand for you to run to Vergesso.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_13,Han Solo: Vergesso, eh?  Imperial cargo depot.  What am I stealing?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_14,Mon Mothma: Not stealing - planting.  You're going to find a particular cargo container that is destined for an Imperial research facility, and place a device in it.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_15,Han Solo: This device wouldn't be of the explosive persuasion, would it?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_16,Mon Mothma: Let's just say you should be very careful.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_17,Han Solo: Don't worry.  I do this sort of thing all the time.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_18,Mon Mothma: Han Solo must perform this task alone.  Too many ships would draw unwanted attention to the area.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_03,Mon Mothma: The data we recovered from Tarkin's research station has provided some information on the Death Star, but not enough technical detail to move against it.  I hope that our friend in the senate will turn up more.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_04,Mon Mothma: Before returning home, Ackbar told us that the development research on the Mon Calamari cruisers was annexed by the Empire and is being kept in a vault on Carida.  With this data, the Mon Calamari could build their massive capital ships, giving us a great advantage against Imperial Star Destroyers.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_05,Rebel Soldier: Han Solo has arrived, as you requested, Mon Mothma.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_06,Han Solo: Couldn't do without me, huh?  If you have a paying job, I have to warn you - my price has doubled.  The repairs on the Falcon almost broke me!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_07,Mon Mothma: I can assure you that your ship won't receive a scratch.  In truth, it won't even have to move.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_08,Han Solo: Wait a minute.  I wasn't born yesterday.  What's the catch?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_09,Mon Mothma: The best way to get you to Carida doesn't require your ship.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_10,Han Solo: Carida?  Shipyard?  Hey, wait!  You're not shipping us off like a couple of - Watch it!  Watch it!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_11,Mon Mothma: You should be very familiar with that system because of your days in the Academy, but it is exceedingly difficult to get landing clearances for Imperial deserters there.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_12,Rebel Soldier: The shuttle is ready to take the container to Carida.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_13,Mon Mothma: Good.  See that it arrives safely.  We want our smugglers in good shape.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_14,Mon Mothma: I have a task for our smuggler friend.  Send the word out that we are hiring, and for a substantial fee.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_15,Rebel Soldier: Right away!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_16,Mon Mothma: We've lost contact with Captain Solo and Chewbacca.  Their mission is vital - we must recover them and try again!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_17,Han Solo: How did I know she'd ask us to do this!  I know it's hot in here!  Try not to breathe so much!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_18,Han Solo: Ow!  Chewie, you ok?  I think we've landed.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_19,Han Solo: Sounds like we're clear.  Help me with this door, will you?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_20,Han Solo: No amount of money is worth this!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_21,Han Solo: We're in the middle of an Imperial city - how are we ever going to find the schematics?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_22,Han Solo: Hmm... looks like that storage area is our best bet.  You said it Chewie - I've got a bad feeling about this too.  Looks like we'll have to be a bit creative in how we get over there....
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_24,Han Solo: That should do it!  Now let's go get the ship schematics!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_25,Han Solo: Finally!  This looks like the right stuff to me.  Let's get it and get out of here!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_26,Han Solo: Hey Chewie - one of those TIE Maulers may come in handy.  Why don't you go borrow it?

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_29,Han Solo: Yeah, I bet it's cramped!  I doubt they had Wookiees in mind as the pilots, pal.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_31,Han Solo: Watch out for those sensors, Chewie.  The regular troopers may not know you're piloting one of their vehicles, but those certainly will!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_32,Han Solo: Ugh.  That's a bit too many to take head-on.  Let me shut 'em down before you move in, Chewie.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_34,Han Solo: Those troopers should be easy pickings with the right weapon....
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_35,Han Solo: Wow.  That's a lot of firepower.  Those AT-STs will be a problem unless we can find something more powerful to use on 'em.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_36,Han Solo: Hey Chewie, Imperial tanks!  Why don't you take one for a drive?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_38,Han Solo: That wasn't so hard, was it?  I thought they'd put up more of a fight!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_39,Han Solo: That tower means business.  We need something to take it out at range... look around will ya?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_40,Han Solo: Hmm... that's got some range.  Chewie?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_41,Han Solo: There's no way we're getting close to the storage area with those active.  Let's look for a way to shut off the power.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_42,Han Solo: There she is!  We take that power generator off-line, and we'll be able to walk right past those turbolaser turrets.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_43,Han Solo: Weren't there some shuttles back a little ways?  I think it's time we borrowed one!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_44,Get Han and Chewie to the shuttle landing area.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_45,Han Solo: Alright, we're through with this Rebellion after this, Chewie.  That cause is a one-way ticket to getting us killed.

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_47,Han Solo: Chewie?  Chewie?!  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_04,Han Solo: Ok, that's it.  We're done.  Here's what you were after.  Now give us our fee and we'll be leaving.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_05,Mon Mothma: You've certainly earned this.  The Mon Calamari will be able to restart their production facilities now.  The Alliance would be happy to discuss the possibility of a longer-term relationship if you'd like further work....
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_06,Han Solo: No more discussions!  Every time I listen to you for more than a minute, Chewie and I end up risking our necks!  No thanks!  We're getting as far away from you as possible until this blows over.  C'mon Chewie, let's get out of here while we can.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_08,Mon Mothma: We received an Imperial announcement that Princess Leia Organa's ship, the Tantive IV, was attacked by pirates.  The Empire has promised an investigation, but we are certain that is merely a cover.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_09,Mon Mothma: The Mon Calamari have thrown off Imperial control and attacked the Empire's fleets orbiting above them.  They have pledged their assistance to us and are using the schematics we recovered to rebuild their fleets.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_10,Mon Mothma: True to form, the Empire has wasted no time in assembling a fleet to retake the planet.  If they were to reach Mon Calamari, the devastation to the planet would be catastrophic. 
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_11,Mon Mothma: We have informants in place to alert us when the fleet gets underway.  We must not waste a moment in preparing for this assault.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_12,Rebel Pilot: The Imperial fleet is moving out from Coruscant!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_13,Mon Mothma: We must choose our battles carefully.  This fleet is one of the largest the Empire has ever assembled for such a singular purpose.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_14,Rebel Pilot: How are we going to stop that fleet from rolling over all our defenses?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_15,Mon Mothma: Concentrate your defense efforts along the hyperspace routes to Mon Calamari.  Do whatever it takes to stop the fleet!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_16,Rebel Pilot: The fleet is on approach to Mon Calamari!  It's now or never if we're going to stop them!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_17,Rebel Pilot: The Empire has retaken Mon Calamari!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_18,Mon Mothma: We must free the Mon Calamari from the Empire as soon as possible.  Every moment we waste, more and more of them will be slaughtered in retaliation for their actions.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_20,Rebel Pilot: We've destroyed the fleet!  Mon Calamari is saved!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_21,Mon Mothma: Captain Antilles was piloting that ship, and I can only assume the worst.  He was a true hero and will be missed.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_03,Mon Mothma: Our victory over the Empire's fleet is cause for celebration, but I find it disturbing that they appear almost unconcerned with the loss of ships and personnel.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_04,Rebel Pilot: We decimated almost a quarter of their active fleet.  Rebuilding the ships alone will set them back years!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_05,Mon Mothma: Perhaps... they no longer need the ships.  I fear that the Alliance and all those that cherish freedom in the galaxy are in danger.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_06,Rebel Soldier: Alderaan has been destroyed!  Scouts report there's nothing left but debris!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_07,Mon Mothma: The Empire's plan is more unspeakable than we thought.  They intend to rule or destroy everything in the galaxy.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_08,Rebel Soldier: What can we do against that level of firepower?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_09,Mon Mothma: We must do what we can, and continue our fight against this tyranny.  I only hope that will be enough.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_10,Rebel Soldier: A Corellian freighter just arrived from the vicinity of Alderaan.  They claim to have the data on the Death Star with them.  
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_11,Han Solo: Freighter?  Freighter?!  I'll have you know she's much more than that, pal.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_12,Mon Mothma: It appears you are back in our fold yet again, Captain Solo.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_13,Han Solo: I tell you, if I had known all along what you were up to, I would have just let the Empire catch me on Carida.  I'm just here to drop off that Princess of yours, and those droids.  I'll take my reward and be off.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_14,Mon Mothma: We cannot force you to aid us, but know that if the Empire has its way, you will find no safe haven no matter where you run.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_15,Han Solo: I'll take my chances.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_16,Mon Mothma: General Dodonna's analysis of the Death Star plans provided by Princess Leia has provided us with what might be a weakness in its defenses, and I am afraid that we will soon be forced to put it to the test.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_17,Rebel Pilot: How can we hope to match the firepower of that station?
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_18,Mon Mothma: We cannot match it directly, only try to exploit its weakness.  This is our most desperate hour.  Our fate lies in the hands of our daring pilots.  We must stop the Death Star before it destroys more worlds!
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_19,Mon Mothma: It appears you have a conscience after all.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_20,Han Solo: Don't let that rumor get started - it would be bad for business.  I just couldn't leave without properly saying goodbye is all.
TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_22,Mon Mothma: An Imperial tracking device was found on Han Solo's ship.  It is obvious the Empire is on their way towards us at this very moment.

TEXT_SPEECH_REBEL_CAMPAIGN_INTRO_02,Rebel Pilot: Nothing's simple when you mess with the Empire.

TEXT_SPEECH_SALEUCAMI_INT_TACTICAL_COR43_02,Urai Fen: Governor Koong Eeth has proven difficult.  We aren't going to kill him, maiming him should accomplish our goal.
TEXT_SPEECH_SALEUCAMI_INT_VICTORY_COR43_03,Urai Fen: Well done!  The planet is corrupted.  When the Governor recovers, he will be much more likely to do what we tell him.  Tyber Zann's plans must not be hindered in any way.
TEXT_SPEECH_SALEUCAMI_RKT_VICTORY_COR43_05,Defiler: The Zann Consortium racketeering organization has planet-wide influence on Saleucami.  Our next step is to trick Rebel and Imperial forces to engage in the system, so we can salvage their ships and gain from the battles.

TEXT_SPEECH_TARIS_INT_TACTICAL_COR46_02,Silri: I expect 'Twitch' to be unusually resourceful.  We will lose many units in this battle; only victory concerns me.
TEXT_SPEECH_TARIS_INT_VICTORY_COR46_03,Silri: Rumors of the damage we did to 'Twitch' have spread across the world.  The planet is secure.  The Zann Consortium's plans proceed well.
TEXT_SPEECH_TATOOINE_BLK_VICTORY_COR47_02,Defiler: The Hutts know what they're doing when it comes to maintaining a black market.  The Consortium's plans move quickly in this sector.

TEXT_SPEECH_TEST_EVENT,Welcome to the test Speech Event.
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_LOAD_COR48_01,Tyber Zann: I won't tolerate mistakes in this effort.  Get in, grab Ungarr, and get out.
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_LOSS_COR48_04,Tyber Zann: I needed to use more experienced mercenaries in that raid.  I'll regroup and try again.
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_TACTICAL_COR48_02,Tyber Zann: Ungarr Daris will have many security forces guarding him.  Kill them and take him.
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_TACTICAL_COR48_06,Tyber Zann: Ungarr Daris... You're a very important man.  I'll give you a choice: you can come with me and continue to be an important man, or you can die right here, and now.
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_TACTICAL_COR48_07,Ungarr Daris: I don't want any trouble, just don't hurt my family!
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_TACTICAL_COR48_08,Tyber Zann: As long as you and your family don't upset me, they'll be fine.
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_KID_VICTORY_COR48_03,Tyber Zann: With Ungarr in our control, many useful things can happen on the planet and in that sector of space.
TEXT_SPEECH_THYFERRA_RKT_VICTORY_COR48_05,Defiler: Centering our racketeering efforts around bacta production can bring the economic power of the planet under our control.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_01,Station Officer: An Imperial peace-keeping envoy deployed to Kashyyyk was assaulted by an unusually organized dissident group.  This warrants our full attention.  I am sending you to investigate a derelict space station being used as a haven by these... Rebels.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_02,Station Officer: Direct this space fleet to Kashyyyk and reinforce the Imperial units already en route. Eliminate all resistance, and report back to me at once.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_04,Hint: To attack the Rebel space forces located above Kashyyyk, drag the Imperial fleet from Nal Hutta to Kashyyyk.  Moving a fleet into orbit above an enemy planet will initiate a space battle.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_06,Hint: To take control of the space above Kashyyyk, you will need to eliminate all of the enemy forces and base structures. You will be escorted by an Imperial officer on this mission. This officer will provide you strategic advice from the safety of his shuttle craft.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_07,Shuttle Officer: Welcome to the front line.  We've pinpointed their base of operations and are standing by.  Our orders are to eliminate this station by any means necessary.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_08,Hint: Double-click on any unit to select all visible units of that same type.  Smaller units, such as fighter squadrons, can be selected by clicking on either the squadron icon or on the individual units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_09,Hint: Your units can be assigned to control groups.  Select all units to be added to a control group, and then press the CTRL button and a number key.  Pressing the assigned number key again will select all units within the control group.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_10,Shuttle Officer: We will need to navigate through this hazardous terrain to reach our destination.  Stay away from the asteroid fields, and stay alert.  This area is ripe for an ambush, and we can't afford to take any losses!  Follow me.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_12,Hint: Asteroid fields damage larger units over a period of time.  If a large ship travels through an asteroid field it may become heavily damaged or destroyed.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_13,Shuttle Officer: Incoming hostiles!  Remember your training!  Divert power to weapons!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_15,Hint: When using fighter units to attack enemy fighter or bomber squadrons, they will engage in a dogfight.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_16,Hint: Use the Tartan Cruiser's Power to Weapons ability to increase the ship's rate of fire and destroy the fighter squadrons blocking your path.  Select your Tartan Cruiser units, then click on the Power to Weapons ability icon, located on the command bar.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_17,Shuttle Officer: Good job.  Watch out for those nebula fields.  They'll wreak havoc on our auxiliary systems.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_19,Hint: Nebula Fields are swirling clouds of gas and dust that can be found in space.  These fields do not damage ships, but they do disable the use of unit abilities, such as the Power to Weapons ability.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_20,Shuttle Officer: Incoming hostiles!  Open fire!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_21,Shuttle Officer: Imperial scouts reported a frigate ship along with a bomber squadron in the vicinity.  Take a moment to allow our shields to regenerate before advancing.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_22,Hint: Shield status is reflected by a blue bar on a ship's health meter.  Shields regenerate over time for most space units.  Hull status is reflected by a green meter.  Unlike shield damage, hull damage does not regenerate over time.  If a ship's hull is destroyed, the ship will be destroyed.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_23,Shuttle Officer: Okay, let's move out... follow me.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_24,Shuttle Officer: There they are!   The frigate has been damaged, probably by one of our patrols.  If those bombers manage to attack us first, their torpedoes will tear our hulls apart.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_26,Hint: Units with torpedo projectiles, such as bombers, are able to bypass shields on all ships and structures.  This makes them extremely dangerous.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_28,Shuttle Officer: Good work.  That damaged frigate lies between us and the Rebel station.  Even wounded, it poses a threat.  As we approach we will need to intercept any Rebel fighter squadrons with our scouts, and direct all other units to attack the frigate.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_29,Hint: Destroy the hard-points on larger ships and space stations to disable critical parts like weapons, shields, and engines.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_30,Hint: Only units with torpedo projectiles (such as bombers) can attack hard-points on a ship or structure while the shields are functioning.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_31,Acclamator Pilot: Assault fleet, this is Imperial Acclamator oh-one-niner.  We are en-route to reinforce your position and are awaiting your coordinates.  Confirm.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_32,Shuttle Officer: Good!  We will need reinforcements to commence with our assault.  Deploy our reinforcement ships and bring more firepower to bear against that space station.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_34,Hint: To bring reinforcements into a battle, select the reinforcement button, then drag and release the ships into space from the reinforcement window.  Remember - reinforcements can only be released in open space, away from enemy structures and other hazards. 
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_35,Shuttle Officer: Watch out for those ion fields!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_36,Hint: Ion Fields are swirling clouds of charged gas and dust that can be found in space.  These fields do not damage ships, but they do disable unit abilities and shield regeneration.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_37,Shuttle Officer: Be careful.  This doesn't look like the work of space rabble... the shields on that derelict space station have been restored.  Approach the station with Fighter Squadrons to draw its fire, and use other units to eliminate the remaining hard-points.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_39,Hint: Small fighters are useful against space stations because of their speed and small size.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_40,Hint: Destroy the shield generator hard-point for enemy ships and space stations to disable their ability to regenerate shields.  This will make them more vulnerable to attack, and easier to destroy.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_41,Shuttle Officer: Excellent work!  Let's return to base.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_43,Hint: Broadside Cruiser ships are long range units that are strong against space stations.  In addition, these ships have the Barrage ability.  To use this ability: select a Broadside Cruiser unit, click on the Barrage ability icon, and then target enemy units or structures using the left-mouse-button.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_54,Hint: Select your units by left-clicking on them, and then issue a move command by right-clicking on the desired map location.  Scroll the tactical display by moving your cursor to the edge of the screen, or by using the keyboard arrow keys.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_55,Hint: Select your units by left-clicking on them, and then issue an attack command by right-clicking on enemy units.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_56,Hint: Before you can complete your training, you must also learn how to command space forces in battle.  Let's examine another conflict, this time from the perspective of the Empire.  In this case, the Empire faction is attempting to eliminate a Rebel space station located in orbit above Kashyyyk.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_57,Hint: Acclamator ships contain TIE fighters and TIE bombers, as well as the Power to Weapons ability to help you destroy the Rebel space station.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT03_58,Hint: To view this battle from a cinematic perspective - select the cinematic camera option, located on the command bar.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_01,Station Officer: Hmph...  It appears the Rebels we encountered on Kashyyyk have fled the system.  Clearly, this petty Rebellion is far less organized than I had originally thought.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_02,Station Officer: Take these forces, capture Kashyyyk, and report back to me immediately.  Considering that there is absolutely no resistance on Kashyyyk, even you should have no problem with this simple task.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_04,Hint:  To move a fleet across the galaxy, drag the fleet icon to the space slot above a planet.  Once your fleet is in orbit above Kashyyyk you can then drag them to the surface of the planet to capture it. 
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_05,Hint: Capturing Kashyyyk has increased the total number of units that you can build, as well as the number of credits that you collect at the end of every Galactic Day.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_06,Station Officer: Excellent...
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_07,Hint: A trade route now connects Kashyyyk and Nal Hutta, increasing the total number of credits generated by the connected planets.  Trade routes also increase the movement speed of any friendly fleets traveling along their path.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_08,Station Officer: Now that we control Kashyyyk we can use our newfound credits to improve our assets on Nal Hutta.  See to it, at once...
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_10,Hint:  Upgrading your space station will make it a stronger defensive structure, and will also allow you to support more units.  Switch to space production mode by selecting the space production tab.  Then, build a Space Station by clicking on the Space Station icon.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_11,Station Officer: Unlike those vile Rebels, we do not poach technology from others, nor do we kidnap scientists.  Construct a Research Facility, and begin research on technology level 2.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_14,Hint: Unlike the Rebels, all Empire-based technology is dependent upon the presence of base structures, known as Research Facilities.  Switch to land production mode by selecting the land production tab.  Then, build a Research Facility by clicking on the Research Facility icon.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_20,Station Officer: Apparently, a Moff on Coruscant has detected an anomaly within our quarterly reserve reports.  Considering that I personally oversee all of your credit transactions, there can only be one explanation: there is a smuggler in our midst!  Direct a Bounty Hunter from the local Hutt Palace to eliminate the smuggler on Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_22,Hint: Whenever the total credit value of a planet is modified it will be visible at the planet itself.  In this case, the credits generated at Nal Hutta have been reduced by the presence of an enemy smuggler.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_23,Station Officer: The captured smuggler has proven to be... uncooperative.  Regardless, his ship logs reveal he could only have originated from a nearby system.  Deploy as many Probe Droids as needed to locate his employers!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_25,Hint: In order to receive information on nearby enemy systems, the Empire must use Probe Droids.  Whenever Probe Droids are deployed to the surface of a planet, information about that planet will be revealed to the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_26,Station Officer: Failure is unacceptable.  Keep searching...
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_27,Hint: Probe Droids serve as disposable spy units for the Empire.  Unlike the Rebel Alliance, the Empire does not receive information about nearby enemy planets.  Gather more information about nearby enemy planets, by deploying Imperial Probe Droids to the ground slot of each planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_28,Station Officer: We will extend the search radius to other, nearby planets.  Find them - do not fail me again!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_29,Station Officer: Unbelievable!  More dissidents?!  Prepare our forces; we must stamp out this new uprising immediately!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_30,Station Officer: If we are to succeed in our assault we will need to employ a strategy of my own making... one that requires both skill and cunning... one that will assure us a victory with minimal risk...
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_31,Station Officer: We will direct our Acclamator ships to unleash their bomber squadrons upon the Rebels until they submit, and then - when they march, arms-raised, from their pitiful, smoldering base we will bomb them again!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_33,Hint: Most Imperial ships, such as Acclamator ships, contain bomber units.  Whenever bomber units are positioned in orbit above an enemy planet, bombing run attacks may be used while you are involved in a land battle at that planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_34,Station Officer: To ensure a certain level of... competence on this mission, I require a senior officer to accompany you.  Recruit a Field Commander from the Officer Academy on Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_36,Hint: Field Commanders provide combat bonuses to all friendly units within a battle.  You must have access to an Officer Academy in order to recruit a Field Commander.  Switch to land production mode by selecting the land production tab.  Then, build a Officer Academy and Field Commander by clicking on the appropriate icons.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_37,Station Officer: Excellent, now consolidate the land and space fleets on Nal Hutta, so that we may commence with the assault.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_39,Station Officer: Deploy units to the surface of Ryloth.  Take no prisoners!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_41,Hint: To initiate a Land Tactical battle, drag the fleet into the land slot on Ryloth.  Remember - while you have bomber units in orbit above the planet you will also have access to Bombing Runs.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_43,Hint: You may issue production commands while the game is paused for an impending battle.  Galactic production will resume once all battles have been resolved.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_44,Station Officer: Yes... good!  All of the necessary components are finally in place. The Rebels won't know what hit them.  Ryloth will be mine!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_45,Hint:  Larger ships, like Acclamators, have a significant impact towards the maximum unit capacity provided by planets and space stations. Once that limit is reached, you cannot create new units until more planets are acquired
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_63,Hint: Bounty Hunters are spy units that can be used to neutralize enemy hero units.  A Bounty Hunter is available on Nal Hutta because a Hutt Palace is present on this planet.  To Neutralize the enemy Smuggler, drag the Bounty Hunter to the Neutralize Hero slot located on Nal Hutta, and then select the unit to be neutralized.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_64,Hint: Since there are no Rebel forces on Kashyyyk, the Empire can capture the planet without entering into a land battle.  Whenever you capture a planet, you will be rewarded with credits, as well as the ability to support more units.  The more planets that you capture, the larger your forces can become.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_65,Hint: Upgrading your technology level will provide you with access to new units, structures, and upgrades.  Switch to land production mode by selecting the land production tab.  Then, upgrade your technology level by clicking on the Upgrade Technology icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT04_70,Hint: You have found Pirates.  While they are hostile to the Empire, these aren't the Rebels you're looking for.    Gather more information about nearby enemy planets, by deploying Imperial Probe Droids to the ground slot of each planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_01,Field Commander: This clearing is suitable for use as a Reinforcement Point.  Secure the area, and deploy our scouts.  We'll launch the assault from this position.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_03,Hint: The area surrounding a Reinforcement Point must be clear of enemies before it may be captured.  Remember - you can use Build Pads to purchase defensive structures in strategic areas, such as this Reinforcement Point.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_05,Hint: Land reinforcements can only be deployed in controlled areas, known as Reinforcement Points.  Conquering Reinforcement Points is of particular strategic importance in this game.  The amount of units you can bring into any Reinforcement Point is determined by that Point's capacity, denoted by the number shown.  Once you reach that capacity, you can no longer land units at that particular Reinforcement Point.  You will have to conquer another Reinforcement Point to bring down more units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_06,Field Commander: A sandstorm!  It will, no doubt, prove to be a nuisance - but it will not stop us from achieving victory!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_07,Hint: Foul weather can reduce the effectiveness of your units.  You must account for weather changes whenever you are engaged in battle on a planet's surface.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_08,Field Commander: The locals are supporting the Rebel forces on this system.  Eliminate them - we cannot afford to lose control of the Reinforcement Point!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_10,Hint: When invading the surface of a planet, it is vital you maintain control of as many Reinforcement Points as possible since you can only deploy reinforcements near areas that you control.  If the defender gains control of a Reinforcement Point, you will not be able to deploy reinforcements at that location.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_11,Field Commander: Good work!  They'll think twice before interfering in Imperial affairs. Now, about that Rebel base...
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_12,Field Commander: The Rebels apparently have a Base Shield Generator.  Clever, but it won't stop us for long - locate the Power Generator supplying power to that shield, and destroy it!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_14,Hint: Base Shield Generators provide the defender with a significant advantage by blocking enemy blaster fire and reducing the movement speed of enemy units.  Base Shield Generators require Power Generators in order to function.  This means that if you destroy the Power Generator, the Base Shield will be disabled.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_15,Hint: Since bombing-capable units are in orbit above this system, Bombing Runs are available for use in this battle.  Select the Bombing Run icon on the command bar, and then target a visible area to bomb by left-clicking on the battlefield.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_16,Field Commander: The Base Shield Generator is down!  All units - attack the Rebel base!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_18,Hint: Use your forces and special abilities, such as bombing runs, to destroy enemy turrets, buildings, and other base defenses.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_19,Station Officer: Good... very good!  Not only has the Rebel base been destroyed, but we now control all of the resources provided by Ryloth.  Grand Moff Tarkin will be pleased to hear of my success!  You are dismissed...
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_26,Hint: Imperial forces have detected the Rebel presence here on the surface of Kashyyyk.  You will need to gather your troops and attack the Alliance base on this planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_27,Hint: To accomplish this, you must make use of the units and special abilities that have been brought to this planet.  Eliminate all enemy units and structures to gain control of the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_28,Hint: Beware of indigenous units, such as Jawas.  These forces will continue to attack until their habitat has been destroyed.  Use your forces to destroy the Jawa Sandcrawler.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_37,Hint:  Darth Vader will accompany you on this mission so that he may investigate the Rebel presence on Ryloth personally.  Hero units, including Darth Vader, are special units that can be used to turn the tide of even the most difficult battles.  Use Darth Vader's special abilities to ensure victory on this planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_EMPIRE_ACT05_42,Hint: During the course of a battle you will occassionally encounter structures, such as this abandonded mining facility.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_16,Rebel Soldier: Sir!  This jamming device has Imperial markings!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_17,Patrol Leader: Delta Base, this is patrol squad three.  Imperial forces have breached the perimeter!  I repeat, Imperial forces have breached the perimeter!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_18,Base Dispatch: Acknowledged, squad three.  All units, return to base!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_20,Patrol Leader: Let's move out!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_21,Hint: To move your selected troops to the Rebel base, you can give them movement orders by right-clicking directly on the battlefield map or on the mini-map.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_22,Hint: When moving multiple units, a single-click movement order will force units to move at the speed of the slowest unit, while a double-click allows the units to move independently.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_23,Hint: Press the Tab key to zoom-out even further.  The zoomed-out view will provide you with an overview of the battlefield that can be extremely useful when moving your troops over long distances.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_28,Hint: Build defensive structures to prepare for the incoming Imperial attack by right-clicking on the Build Pads located near the base walls, and then selecting a defensive structure to be built.  Currently, you can build a turret and a bacta healing station, but more structures will be available later in the game.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_29,Hint: Turrets attack enemy units automatically, which makes them extremely useful for base defense.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_30,Hint: Bacta Healing Stations heal infantry units when they are within range of the station.  To see the healing range of a Bacta Healing Station, simply left-click on the station.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_31,Hint: Turrets automatically attack enemy units.  Since Turrets are stationary structures you may not issue move commands to them, but you can direct a Turret to target specific enemy units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_32,Hint: If your Build Pad structures are destroyed, they can be rebuilt; but remember - all nearby enemies must be eliminated before you may reuse a Build Pad.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_33,Imperial Scout: Rebel scum!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_34,Base Dispatch: Incoming Imperial forces!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_36,Patrol Leader: Remember your training - take cover!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_37,Hint:  Infantry units have the Take Cover ability.  To use this ability: select an Infantry unit, and then click on the Take Cover ability icon located on the command bar.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_38,Hint: As an infantry squad takes casualties, the health meter for that squad will be reduced.  Use the Bacta Healing Station to heal any wounded infantry units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_39,Hint: As the defender you have access to garrisoned units.  These units are found by selecting certain structures in the Rebel base. They can be used to replenish lost forces.  Check the Rebel base for any garrisoned units which may become available.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_40,Base Dispatch: Incoming walkers!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_41,Patrol Leader: All PLEX Soldiers, attack!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_42,Hint: Every unit has strengths and weaknesses that can be exploited to win battles.  PLEX Rocket Soldiers are strong against lightly armored units, like these AT-ST walkers.  Command your PLEX Soldiers to attack the AT-ST units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_43,Base Dispatch: The base is secure!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_44,Patrol Leader: We need to reclaim all Reinforcement Points to our east.  Otherwise, the Imperials will continue to attack our position.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_48,Hint: Remember, you can review your mission objectives at any time by clicking on the Mission Holocron option, located on the left side of the Command Bar.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_49,Hint: Units can be assigned to control groups.  Select all units to be added to the group, and then press the CTRL button and a number key.  Pressing the assigned number key again selects all units in the control group.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_50,Hint: Capturing the Reinforcement points will prevent the enemy from landing even more troops.  To capture a Reinforcement Point, you must eliminate all enemy units in the area and remain near the Reinforcement point until it turns green.  Note that every Reinforcement Point has a limit to how many units it can accommodate, denoted by the number shown.  In Tutorial 5, we'll give you the opportunity to bring reinforcements into a land battle.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_51,Hint: Remember, garrisoned units can be used to replenish lost forces.  Don't forget to check the Rebel base for any Garrisoned units that may become available.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_52,Hint: Units may be ordered to fight any enemies they encounter, while moving to a destination. This is known as an attack-move.  To issue an attack-move order, select your units, then select the Attack option located on the Command Bar, before targeting the desired destination.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_53,Patrol Leader: Secure that Reinforcement Point!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_54,Patrol Leader: Incoming Imperials!  Open fire!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_55,Patrol Leader: Area secure!  Let's keep moving!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_56,Patrol Leader: Area secure!  That's all of them!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_57,Base Dispatch: Sir, I'm receiving reports that a massive Imperial Fleet is en route to Kashyyyk!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_58,Patrol Leader: This system is no longer secure.  We need to evacuate this base immediately.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_60,Hint: Retreating allows you to save your units from certain destruction whenever you are faced with overwhelming odds.  Remember - you can always return to a battle later with additional units.  Select the retreat button on your command bar to take your remaining forces and regroup them on another planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_61,Patrol Leader: Inform the main Alliance fleet that the Empire is aware of our presence on Kashyyyk.  The rest of you - prepare for evacuation!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_62,Rebel Soldier: Yes, sir!  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_63,Hint: While the retreat timer is active, your units are more vulnerable to enemy attacks.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_64,Patrol Leader: I can only hope that the Imperials haven't uncovered any other Alliance outposts.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_78,Hint: Imperial forces have detected the Rebel presence here on the surface of Kashyyyk.  You will need to gather your troops and defend the Alliance base on this planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_79,Hint: To accomplish this, you must command ground units, like these Rebel Soldiers who are currently on patrol, to eliminate the enemy invaders; but before you begin, it is critical that you also understand how to use the command bar.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_80,Hint: To view the entire battlefield, use the mini-map located in the bottom left corner of the screen.  Friendly units on the mini-map are displayed in green, while enemy units are red.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_81,Hint: The highlighted buttons represent advanced movement options, which are not covered in this tutorial. Please refer to the manual for a detailed description of their functions.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_82,Hint: Select the Rebel soldiers by left-clicking on them.  Whenever a unit has been selected, an icon for that unit will be displayed on the command bar.  You may view the status of your units, or activate special unit abilities from within this area.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_83,Hint: Now that you are familiar with the command bar, you can take control of this Rebel patrol squad.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_84,Hint: Bacta Healing Stations will heal infantry units.  To heal damaged infantry units, move them within range of the Bacta Healing Station.  To see the healing range of a Bacta Healing Station, simply hover your mouse cursor over the station.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT01_85,Hint: Use your Rebel infantry units and defensive structures to defend against the attacking, Imperial forces.  Select your units with the left mouse button, and target enemy units using the right mouse button.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_01,Hint: Since you have successfully retreated from Kashyyyk you can continue to command the surviving forces from that battle within the Galactic View.  This view allows you to manage the resources on all of your planets, including your economy, bases, and units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_02,Patrol Leader: We need to evacuate Kashyyyk and reinforce the main Alliance fleet at Bothawui.  Prepare for departure by moving our ground forces into orbit above Kashyyyk.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_04,Hint: Units within the Galactic View are represented by stacks of units, known as Fleets.  The strongest unit within a Fleet is always displayed on top.  Move these ground forces into orbit by dragging them from the surface of Kashyyyk into one of the available slots located above the planet.  This will prepare them for space travel.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_05,Patrol Leader: Good work.  I'll transmit the system coordinates for Bothawui to you now... stand by.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_06,Hint: To access a more detailed view of a selected planet, click on the zoom-in icon, located on the Mini-Map.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_07,Patrol Leader: There it is... direct all fleets located on Kashyyyk to move to Bothawui.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_09,Hint: Whenever a system has been selected, a ring is also displayed.  This ring indicates the approximate distance that a fleet can travel into unexplored territory, from that planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_10,Hint: Mission objectives in Galactic Mode can be reviewed at any time by selecting the Mission Holocron option, located on the Command Bar.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_108,Hint: To obtain more resources, it will be necessary for you to claim another planet.  Capturing a planet will increase the total number of credits that you collect at the end of every Galactic Day.  It will also increase the total number of units that you can support.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_109,Hint: Ryloth is currently unoccupied.  This means that it should be an easy planet to capture.  Begin the process of capturing Ryloth by moving your forces into orbit above Ryloth.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_11,Patrol Leader: The main Alliance fleet should be within sight once we arrive.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_110,Hint: Your forces must occupy the surface of a planet in order to capture it.  To do this, simply move your fleet into the ground slot located near the center of the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_115,Hint: Let's take a closer look at Ryloth.  To access a more detailed view of a planet, select the planet, and then click on the Zoom-In icon, located on the Mini-Map.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_116,Hint:  Base Shield Generators are ground structures that provide defense for ground bases.  Switch to ground production mode by selecting the ground production tab.  Then, build a Base Shield Generator by clicking on the Base Shield Generator icon.

TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_12,Patrol Leader: There they are!  Now we need to join them.  Give the order, and we'll combine our fleets.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_14,Hint: To move several units from one fleet to another, click on a stack of units while pressing and holding the CTRL key until you have moved the stack of selected units to the desired fleet position.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_15,Patrol Leader: Reporting for duty!
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_16,Mon Mothma: Welcome.  I am relieved to see that you survived the Empire's assault on Kashyyyk, but our situation is still dire.  You are all that remains of the forces there, and we have no other resources to draw upon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_17,Mon Mothma: As you can see, the Rebel Alliance currently controls Bothawui.  The Bothawui system is providing us with a modest credit supply, but if we are to withstand another attack from the Empire, we will need to find additional sources of income.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_18,Hint: Whenever a system is captured it provides a one-time credit bonus, and increases the rate which you accumulate credits.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_19,Mon Mothma: There are a small number of nearby systems which may serve as suitable candidates.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_20,Mon Mothma: Unlike the Empire, we do not prey on other systems to support our cause.  Instead, we prefer to acquire the bulk of our tactical resources in a way that undermines the Empire itself.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_21,Mon Mothma: Fortunately for us, our spy network provides us with the advantage of being completely aware of all Empire-controlled systems within the immediate area.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_22,Hint: Friendly systems are green, enemy systems are red, pirate systems are yellow, and neutral systems are gray.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_23,Mon Mothma: A smuggler on Bothawui has agreed to support our cause, and can be deployed to Nal Hutta.  Direct our smuggler to siphon credits from Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_24,Siphon Credits from Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_24A,Hint: A smuggler is available on Bothawui because a Cantina is present on this system.  If this Cantina was ever destroyed, it would need to be rebuilt before this smuggler could become available again.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_25,Mon Mothma: Good.  As long as our smuggler is deployed at Nal Hutta, we can expect to see an increase in our credit reserves.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_26,Mon Mothma: With this new source of income, we should now have ample resources to assemble several fleets.  First, we will need some additional infantry units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_28,Hint: Once a land unit has completed production, it will appear within the first available ground force position on the planet.  If no ground force positions are available, the unit will be added to the first available space fleet position, above the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_29,Mon Mothma: Good.  We will also need several space units.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_31,Hint: Once a space unit has completed production, it will appear within the first empty space fleet position, above the planet.  If no empty fleet positions are available, the unit will be combined into the first available space fleet instead.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_32,Mon Mothma: Excellent.  However, we will also need access to more advanced units if we expect to defeat the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_33,Mon Mothma: We have built all that we can with our current resources.  Since we acquire our resources in ways that undermine the Empire, we will need to steal technology advancements from the Imperials.  These droids should be able to assist you in this task.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_35,Hint: The Rebel Alliance gains new technology by stealing it directly from Imperial planets.  Move R2-D2 and C-3PO to the Steal slot on Nal Hutta to steal technology from the Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_36,Mon Mothma: Good.  We must also improve our hold on Bothawui by constructing defensive structures.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_38,Hint: A Power Generator will be built automatically for any structures that require power to function, including Base Shield Generators.  Remember - you can zoom-in on a planet to see any units and structures that you may have built.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_39,Mon Mothma: Now that our defenses are in place we should take steps to reinforce the neighboring planet of Tatooine.  Unfortunately, the space above Tatooine has been blockaded by an Imperial fleet, so we will need to make use of a Raid fleet.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_40,Mon Mothma: Unlike normal fleets, Raid fleets do not initiate space combat on enemy systems.  Using Raid fleets allow us to reinforce or assault systems which are blockaded by enemy fleets.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_41,Hint: The Rebel Alliance can use Raid Fleets to bypass space battles within enemy territory by moving directly to a planet's surface.  This allows the Rebel Alliance to reinforce friendly planets blocked by enemy space units, or even capture undefended enemy planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_42,Mon Mothma: Create a Raid fleet using some of our newly-recruited infantry, and reinforce the defenses on Tatooine.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_44,Hint:  Create a Raid Fleet by dragging a small number of infantry units into a space slot above Bothawui, so that they can then be moved into the Raid slot located on Tatooine.  This will allow these infantry units to bypass the Empire forces in space above Tatooine, and land directly on the planet's surface.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_45,Mon Mothma: Well done.  The additional support at Tatooine should allow our forces there to endure any sudden Imperial attacks.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_46,Mon Mothma: It appears Imperial forces are assaulting Kashyyyk sooner than I had anticipated.  I sincerely hope that our efforts to bolster these systems will suffice.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_48,Hint: he zoomed-in view allows you to review the contents and statistics for each planet.  Within this view you can manage your fleet contents, examine current planetary structures, view space station level or even sell ground base structures that are no longer needed on that planet.  
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_49,Hint: To manage fleets within this view, simply drag and drop the units to a location.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_50,Hint: Create a raid fleet by dragging the ground units shown here into orbit.  To move a unit into orbit, simply drag and drop the units to the desired fleet position.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_53,Hint: You will now need to bypass the Empire space units positioned above Tatooine.  To do this, simply drag the Rebel Raid Fleet from Bothawui to the Raid slot located on Tatooine.  This will place the infantry units directly on the surface of Tatooine.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_54,Hint: Hover the mouse cursor over any item that you wish to receive detailed information for and a tool-tip will be displayed.  Choose a technology to steal from the Empire by selecting it from the available list.  Whenever the Rebel faction exhausts all possible technology options, they will advance to the next technology level.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_68,Hint: Combining two fleets will create a single fleet that is larger and more powerful.  To combine your fleets, simply drag and drop one fleet icon onto another.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_69,Hint: Smugglers are spy units that can be used to increase your credit supply, without the need to capture planets.  A Smuggler is available on Bothawui because a Cantina is present on this planet.  To Steal Credits from the Empire drag the Smuggler unit to the Steal Credits slot on Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_70,Hint: You will need to create ground forces in order to defend the surface of the planet.  Since you have built a barracks you now have the ability to create more ground units.  Switch to ground production mode by selecting the ground production tab.  Then, recruit two Rebel Infantry squads by clicking twice on the Rebel Infantry icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_71,Hint:  You will also need to create a space fleet in order to protect the space around the planet.  Now that you have created a fully operational space station, you have the ability to build ships. Switch to space production mode by selecting the space production tab.  Then, build two X-Wing Fighter squadrons by clicking twice on the X-Wing Fighter icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_72,Hint: You will need to build a Barracks before you can recruit infantry.  Building a Barracks will provide you with basic ground defenses, as well as the ability to recruit infantry units.  Switch to ground production mode by selecting the ground production tab.  Then, build a Barracks by clicking on the Barracks icon.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_73,Hint: To zoom-out from a system, click on the zoom icon, located on the command bar.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_74,Hint: Smugglers can provide additional income that can be useful whenever you are unable to capture enemy planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_79,Hint: You will need to build a Space Station before you can build space units.  Building a Space Station will provide you with basic space defenses, as well as the ability to build space units.  Switch to space production mode by selecting the space production tab.  Then, build a Space Station by clicking on the Space Station icon. 
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_80,Hint: Constructing multiple buildings of the same type on a planet will give you bonuses, such as faster build times for specific units, but remember - each planet has a limited capacity for structures.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_81,Hint: Every planet within the Star Wars galaxy is unique - possessing distinct terrain features, weather patterns, indigenous life, bonuses, and other attributes.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_82,Hint: Tool-tips are present for all planets, structures, units, fleets, and buttons.  Hover your mouse cursor over any item in the game that you wish to receive more detailed information for, and a tool-tip will be displayed.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_83,Hint: Whenever you capture a planet, you will be rewarded with credits.  Credits can be used to purchase new units, structures, and upgrades.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_84,Hint: You will receive money from all of the planets under your control at the end of each Galactic Day.  The more planets that you control, the more credits you will receive.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_91,Hint: Whenever a ground base structure has been built, it will become visible within this view.  Building base structures will increase your ground base level.  There are a limited number of land slots available to build upon, so you must choose wisely when building your base.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_92,Hint: Whenever a space station has been built, it will become visible within this view.  Unlike ground bases, space station levels can only be increased by upgrading the space station.
TEXT_SPEECH_TUTORIAL_REBEL_ACT02_93,Hint: Whenever a unit has been created, it will become visible within this view.  The number of units that you can support is limited, so you must choose wisely when constructing your fleets.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_00,Tyber Zann: We have concealed ourselves in a small asteroid belt near our destination.  One of our advantages is that the Zann Consortium ships possess the ability to hide in asteroid fields indefinitely without taking any damage.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_01,Tyber Zann: We are here to corrupt Mandalore, not conquer it.  Corrupting planets will increase our notoriety throughout the galaxy, and allow us to further the interests of the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_02,Tyber Zann: We will need to hijack the Supreme Strategist's ship in order to spread corruption to Mandalore.  This will allow us to intimidate the Mandalorians and offer them 'protection' from further pirate activities.  Our objective will be approaching shortly, enroute to the Hutt asteroid base orbiting Mandalore.  He has set up a perimeter of V-wings to prepare for his arrival.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_03,Tyber Zann: Those V-wing fighters should be no match for our fighters, which are equipped with buzz droids.  Use our fighters' buzz droid special ability to clear out the V-wings before the Supreme Strategist arrives.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_04,Tyber Zann: Good.  Now, we will ambush the Supreme Strategist when he arrives, and show the galaxy that the Zann Consortium is a force to be reckoned with!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_05,Tyber Zann: There he is!  Hijack his ship by destroying his engines, and bringing the boarding shuttle near his ship!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_06,Tyber Zann: Well done.  We've now established a base for piracy on Mandalore.  This corruption sets up the Zann Consortium for our black market efforts on Nal Hutta!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PIRACY_TUTORIAL_07,Supreme Strategist: It's an ambush!  All hands to battle stations; we'll teach those pirate scum to stay clear of Mandalore!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_00,Zann Consortium Soldier: We've located a small clearing near the Hutt Cartel's landing party.  The landing area should have enough cover to hide our forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_01,Tyber Zann: Excellent!  Ensure that we are not detected by the Hutt forces on the ground.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_02,Tyber Zann: Alpha squad, scout the area and make certain our path is clear.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_03,Tyber Zann: Looks like our ship will be a little lighter for the return trip; apparently, some of the local foliage isn't safe for infantry...  Bring out the transport!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_04,Tyber Zann:  I can garrison my troops inside the transport and protect them from those poisonous plants.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_05,Hint: Select your troops and right click on the transport to garrison the selected units within it.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_06,Tyber Zann: When everyone's inside the transport, we'll go retrieve that artifact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_07,Tyber Zann: Blast it!  The path ahead is traversable only with infantry.  Everyone out!  We'll need to go the rest of the way on foot.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_08,Tyber Zann: We're no match for those anti-infantry turrets!  Urai, we'll have to use our cloaking fields and sneak the rest of the way to the Hutt landing site.  We need to make sure we get there before our cloaking fields run out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_09,Hutt Mercenary: This place creeps me out.  I wish Jabba would--
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_10,Hutt Soldier: Look out!  It's Urai Fen!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_11,Urai Fen: The artifact is ours!  What is the next step?
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_12,Tyber Zann: Get those troops back to cover!  Urai and I must go alone from here on.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_13,Tyber Zann: We need to protect our landing site from anyone who might stumble across it.  Get out the MDUs and deploy them.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_14,Hint: Deploy a Mobile Defense Unit, or MDU, by clicking on its 'Deploy' button, then Left-Click on the unit to access its build menu.  From there, you can choose what to build on top of the MDU.  The MDU cannot move again until the object on top is sold or destroyed and the unit is undeployed.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_15,Hint: To eject units from a transport or garrisoned structure, select the transport or garrison and Right-Click it to eject all troops.  While the transport or garrison is selected, you can also click on the unit's icon from the selection menu to eject that unit from the garrison.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_16,Hint: The MDU needs to remain at the landing area to protect the transport from attackers.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_17,Hint: Your infantry units will be severely injured if they progress into the poisonous flowers.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_18,Urai Fen: They'll be coming for us at Ryloth once they learn that Tyber doesn't have their precious artifact.  Kamino is an ideal location to lay low while we plan Tyber's escape.  I have connections on Kamino that I trust to hide us for a while.  Build a suitable force and conquer Kamino.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_PROLOGUE_FELUCIA_19,Tyber Zann: Those guard towers will see right through our cloaking fields.  If we try to go that way, we'll get chewed up by anti-infantry turrets.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_00,Hint: The Zann Consortium uses corruption powers, among other abilities, to gain advantages over the Empire and the Rebels.  Pay close attention as you move Tyber Zann through the galaxy, corrupting planets to gain power.  In this scenario, Tyber will direct his Defiler units to corrupt Mandalore, and establish a black market on Nal Hutta, without actually conquering either planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_01,Tyber Zann: A year ago, I joined forces with Jabba the Hutt.  Our combined criminal contacts and resources brought both of us great wealth.  But I never intended to make this alliance permanent.  Recently, Jabba acquired a unique artifact.  From what I can tell, it's cost him nearly half his wealth.  It's too valuable a prize to let my good partner enjoy all by himself.  That artifact will be in my hands soon.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_02,Tyber Zann: I'm going to go to Nal Hutta.  There are Hutt family members that I intend to bribe, so that I find out facts about Jabba and where the closest black market can be found.  The black markets throughout the galaxy are important sources of stolen technology.  As soon as the Empire or Rebel Alliance develop a new tech, it's available on the black market.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_03,Hint: Drag Tyber Zann to the glowing oval above Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_04,Tyber Zann: Most worlds are alike.  There are important officials on the planet who need credits for one reason or another.  The trick is to find them, pay them, and keep them happy.  Once you do this, there is a rippling effect that spreads corruption and loyalty to me around the world.  This time, I go down and find one of the members of Jabba's family.  He's one of the many who doesn't like his cousin, and wants to help my cause.  I've dealt with him in the past, and know his type of criminal well.  It won't be easy to find him; the best acts of corruption are never without a little effort...
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_05,Hint: Take Tyber and explore the landscape. Move past the characters and units you discover on the world. Sometimes these characters will attack and other times they'll ignore you completely. When you are near enough to your mark they will start up a conversation. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_06,Hut-tina, Jabba's fourth cousin: Tyber Zann it has been too long  since we last spoke. I think that drug ring we set up on the outer moons is still running well. What are you and that miserable cousin of mine doing these days?
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_07,Tyber Zann: Never mind the pleasant conversation, Hut-tina. I've got credits for information. I know you helped Jabba hide his new treasure on Felucia. Tell me where it is and I will give you the credits. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_08,Hut-tina: It's really not that easy. First you must deal with the Black Market on Kashyyyk. Once you have the Buzz Droids you'll find there, you must go to Felucia. Jabba's hidden base is there, but don't take a lot of tanks. It's hidden where only your foot troops can go. The Buzz Droids are a vital key toward the success of your mission.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_09,Hint: Tyber summons a Defiler to deal with the black market on Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_10,Hint: To see the cost of bribing your way to a planet, drag your force to your final destination without releasing the mouse button.  The bribe cost will be listed next to your fleet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_100,Hint: Buzz droids will swarm an enemy unit and begin tearing through its hull.  Activate this ability by selecting the highlighted button and targeting an area near your desired target.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_101,Hint: Note that Urai Fen has the innate ability to self-heal.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_102,Hint: The Zann Consortium can either corrupt, or capture planets; the choice is yours.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_103,Hint: Like the original Empire at War, conquering establishes ownership, and allows Tyber to build new bases.  Corrupting an enemy planet leaves the enemy in control, but in return, Tyber gains access to unique missions, tech upgrades, enemy information, increased income, and new space routes.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_11,Tyber Zann: My plans grow apace.  As soon as the agents on Nal Hutta are contacted, I can tap into their black market community.  It's a source of valuable stolen technology.  Now that I know about the black market on Nal Hutta, I can send a Defiler to establish communications with it.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_12,Hint: Drag a Defiler to the 'SPREAD CORRUPTION' slot at the planet Nal Hutta.  Once there, use the Defiler to tap into the black market on Nal Hutta.  There will be chances to contact and gain technology from scientifically rich worlds all over the galaxy.  Once you have set up your connections with the black market, the world will be corrupted, and will serve your cause.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_13,Tyber Zann: Nal Hutta is crawling with Imperial units, so we need to bribe the system officials there to let us fly by unnoticed.  We're going to raid Jabba's hidden base and take his artifact. I'll gather all of my space and land forces and move to Felucia. I don't intend to stay very long -- the planet is too powerful for me to win it over today. But someday, I'll make it a permanent addition to my Consortium. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_14,Tyber Zann: In order to steal the artifact from Jabba and the Empire, we need to make a stealthy approach to Felucia.  One of the special talents of my Defilers is their ability to sabotage structures on enemy planets.  Take this Defiler to Felucia and destroy the Orbital Long Range Scanner there.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_15,Hint: Drag the Defiler to the glowing oval slot on Felucia and destroy the Ion Cannon.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_16,Tyber Zann: Felucia is our goal, but we do not want to draw the Empire's attention.  We will bribe our way past Nal Hutta, and crash Jabba's meeting on Felucia.  Combine all of our forces at Ryloth, and then move them to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_17,Hint: To see the cost of bribing your way to a planet, drag your force to your final destination without releasing the mouse button.  The bribe cost will be listed next to your fleet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_18,Hint: Include Tyber in the invading space fleet and bring all of our space units from Nal Hutta to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_19,Tyber Zann: Now that I've secured the space above Felucia, I can use land forces to raid the planet. There, I'll find the artifact, which I'll use to fund my criminal empire to its fullest potential.  Bring all of my land units from Nal Hutta to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_20,Hint: Bring all of your land units from Nal Hutta to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_21,Tyber Zann: Remember to use the abilities of our heroes to gain an upper hand in this battle.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_22,Tyber Zann: I speak to all of you from the lead transport dropping down to Felucia. Today we strike against Jabba the Hutt. He's an evil creature that has cost the Zann Consortium dearly. Today we get it back. Urai my trusted Vigo is going to collect an important artifact. Make sure all of you help him in his quest. Over and out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_23,Urai: This operation carries great risk, Tyber. Are you sure this artifact is worth it?
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_24,Tyber Zann: I know how much Jabba paid for it, and that he planned to sell it to the Empire for far more. But he's not half the businessman I am, Urai. I'll get twice as much as that worm could ever secure. Just make sure to do your part. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_25,Tyber Zann: Excellent.  We can now use Felucia to produce advanced ships.  I will leave it to you to capture the remaining planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_26,Hint: Use the Defiler to spread corruption to Felucia.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_27,Conquer the remaining planets in the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_28,Tyber Zann: Our Mercenaries are equipped with disruptor technology from the Black Market.  Use these weapons when fighting enemy infantry.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_29,Hint: Make sure you include Tyber in the invading fleet!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_30,Tyber Zann: Their forces are too powerful; we can't take them on just yet!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_31,Tyber Zann: A bunker!  I can use these structures to protect my men on the planet, and to hold key areas of the battlefield.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_32,Tyber Zann: This terrain is far too dense for vehicles, but Consortium troops will have no problem moving through it on foot.  Let's use this to our advantage.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_33,Tyber Zann: Since we have Destroyers in orbit, we can order an orbital bombardment.   This Rebel base would be an ideal target for this new weapon.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_34,Tyber Zann: This would be an ideal time to use the cloaking technology that we purchased on the Black Market.  Use this ability on our Vengeance-Class ships to launch a sneak attack on the nearby Rebel turrets.  They'll never know what hit them.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_35,Tyber Zann: The enemy has bomber units, but we did not come unprepared.  We can easily counter these pests by using the defensive systems on our new Crusader Gunships.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_36,Tyber Zann: We are not bound by the same restrictions that plague our enemies.  There will be no Imperial bureaucracy to slow us down; nor do we adhere to some ridiculous moral code, as do the Rebels.  Nothing will stand in the way of our success.  We will corrupt, sabotage, and annihilate our enemies.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_37,Tyber Zann: I need credits to further grow the Zann Consortium!  I must spread corruption to nearby planets with Defilers.  Once it has been established, my corrupting influence will automatically begin siphoning a percentage of each planet's income.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_38,Hint: Click the 'Base Layout' button on the planetary detail screen, or scroll your mouse wheel to zoom in two times to see the positions of enemy structures and forces.  Scroll your mouse wheel again to zoom out, or click on the magnifying glass icon in the lower left hand corner.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_39,Tyber Zann: Excellent, these Buzz Droids are just the thing I need to destroy Jabba's offworld ships. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_40,Tyber Zann: Whenever an enemy planet has been corrupted we can spy on the activity on that planet. In this case, it appears that the Rebel Alliance is defending Felucia with an Ion Cannon. I hate surprises...
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_41,Tyber Zann: Everyone has a price... use my Bribery ability to sway enemy units to our side. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_42,Tyber Zann: These asteroids pose no threat to my ships. The Rebels and Imperials wish they could say the same! I can use this advantage as part of my tactics, to hide from or evade my enemies.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_43,Tyber Zann: This Rebel space station is heavily shielded, but our Kedalbe ship has the ability to drain enemy's shields.  Let's use their own shields against them!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_44,Hint: Click the Base Layout button on the planetary detail screen or scroll your mouse wheel to zoom in 2 times to configure your base layout to your preferences.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_45,Tyber Zann: Since this planet has been corrupted by our influence, we will receive a bounty for every enemy that we kill.  Apparently, crime does pay.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_46,Tyber Zann: The information I received through bribery has allowed me to pinpoint the location of Jabba's forces. He's set up near an Imperial generator. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_47,Tyber Zann: Destroying the power generator will render the Rebel base shield useless and allow us to launch an assault on their base.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_48,Hint: As long as their base shield is active our planetary bombardment is useless against their factories.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_49,Hint: Defilers spread the will of Tyber Zann across the galaxy.  They infiltrate and corrupt planets using bribery, extortion, assassination, and other underworld tactics.  There will be choices to make when corrupting a world.  These choices determine many things, including the types of units each world produces for the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_50,Hint: From the Advanced Base Layout screen, you can arrange troops and base structures to better defend planets in your possession. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_51,Hint: Technology purchased from the black market will vary depending on many factors.  The cost of stealing certain technologies will change depending on the current tech level of the enemy you're stealing from.  The items you gain from black markets across the galaxy will improve with the number of black markets you set up.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_52,Hint: The cost to destroy each structure is displayed next to it. For our purposes, the Ion Cannon is the only structure that is affordable to sabotage.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_53,Tyber Zann: Direct these mercenaries to enter the bunker by selecting them and clicking on the bunker.  This will garrison them inside the bunker and protect them from any damage, while allowing them to fire upon any nearby enemies.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_54,Hint: To call down reinforcements, click the Call for Reinforcements button.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_55,Hint: Now drag the F9-TZ Transport company from the reinforcement window to your reinforcement point on the land map.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_56,Tyber Zann: Now that those pests have been taken care of, we need to take out that shield generator.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_57,Hint: Load your units into the troop transport by selecting them and clicking on the transport unit, then move the transport to the designated area.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_58,Hint: Some areas are impassable to vehicles and can only be reached by infantry.  Eject your troops and send them to attack Jabba's forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_59,Jabba's Troops: We're under attack call for back up!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_60,Jabba's Troops: There's too many of them! We can't hold out! Where are those reinforcements?
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_61,Jabba: Do not fail me! I've arranged for Imperial reinforcements. If you lose my artifact to Tyber Zann, you will suffer a slow and painful death! 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_62,Tyber Zann: Now that our way is clear, take our forces and destroy the enemy's base. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_63,Tyber Zann: I don't know what this artifact is, but if Jabba thought it was worth a planet's ransom, it's worth finding out. I'm sure whatever secrets it holds will be well worth the cost of this little operation. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_64,Tyber Zann: Urai, you are the only one I would trust with this artifact.  Take it and guard it with your life.  I'll meet with you at the rendezvous point, where we can celebrate our victory.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_65,Stormtrooper: Tyber Zann!  You're under arrest for crimes against the Empire.  Drop your weapons!  If you do not come peacefully, we are authorized to use force!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_66,Tyber Zann: More like crimes against Jabba the Hutt.  Oh, I'll go peacefully.  But you won't hold me for long.  On that, you have the word of Tyber Zann.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_67,Jabba: Tyber Zann. You were scheduled to join me days ago. I thought perhaps something unfortunate happened...
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_68,Jabba: Zann, you fool! Those are my forces above Felucia! If this is some form of betrayal, you won't live to regret it!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_69,Jabba: Zann, remove your forces at once! If you dare attack my base on Felucia, I will send the entire might of the Empire and its fleets against you.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_70,Jabba: Tyber Zann, I know the Imperials have captured you. You will not be allowed the luxury of rotting in prison. My reach is very long. Tell me where you've hidden my artifact! 
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_71,Tyber Zann: I need to establish a black market on Nal Hutta in order to enhance the abilities of my forces around the galaxy.  Before I can establish a black market, I need to show them what I'm capable of.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_72,Zann Consortium Soldier: Mandalore's Supreme Strategist is traveling to the Hutt space station in orbit above Mandalore.  If we can successfully perform an act of piracy at Mandalore, it will open the door to creating a black market on Nal Hutta.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_73,Hint: To perform an act of piracy, drag this Defiler to the 'SPREAD CORRUPTION' slot, on the planet Mandalore.  Defilers are special Consortium units, and are the only ones that can spread corruption.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_74,Hint: When a Defiler attempts to spread corruption at a planet, you will be presented with all of the available corruption options at that planet.  Notice that there are prerequisites that need to be fulfilled to unlock additional corruption options.  Corruption options differ for each planet, so pay close attention to maximize your opportunities.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_75,Hint: Select 'Piracy' from the corruption menu.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_76,Tyber Zann: This will be one of the toughest battles I've ever faced.  The people of Mandalore have been among the best warriors in the galaxy for many generations.  And I'll be facing their most ruthless clan leader in the space above the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_77,Tyber Zann: I've successfully hijacked the Supreme Strategist's ship.  While he rots in our custody, news of our victory will spread fear through every system in the galaxy.  Perhaps other worlds will now think twice about defying the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_78,Tyber Zann: Send my lieutenant Urai Fen to Nal Hutta to purchase Disruptor Technology from the Black Market there.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_79,Urai Fen: At your service.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_80,Urai Fen: Why an Empire planet?  Would it not be better to set up our black market on a Rebel-owned world?  Because of their resistance efforts, they sometimes have access to more exotic technology that we could greatly benefit from.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_81,Tyber Zann: My motives are my own, but I will tell you this: I was rapidly working my way up through the Imperial Academy, but some took exception to my creative solutions for advancement, and had me expelled.  I vowed to make them pay for this indignity.  The Rebellion, and their worlds, may be useful later, but the Empire will start their repayment to me now!  Let's get to work.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_82,Zann Consortium Soldier: We've decoded a message from an Imperial outpost on Felucia that grants surface clearance for Jabba the Hutt.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_83,Tyber Zann: This is it.  Jabba is going to Felucia to sell the artifact to the Empire.  We can pose as Hutt Cartel forces, and sneak onto the planet surface.  Since they're not expecting us, we'll be able to steal the artifact without much trouble.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_84,Fleet Commander: Incoming shuttle, state your purpose for entering Imperial space.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_85,Zann Consortium Soldier: We represent the Hutt Cartel.  We are under orders to deliver an artifact that Jabba is trading with senior Imperial officers.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_86,Fleet Commander: ...all the Hutt Cartel ships have already arrived and are accounted for!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_87,Zann Consortium Soldier: We're arriving separate from the main Hutt fleet to ensure safety for the artifact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_88,Fleet Commander: You are granted clearance to land at the Hutt landing site.  If there is any deviation from that course, we will fire upon your vessel.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_89,Tyber Zann: This worked out better than I thought.  They've given us the exact location of Jabba and the real artifact.  Hurry, we've no time to waste!
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_90,Tyber Zann: We need to bring all of our forces to Felucia before we can invade.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_91,Tyber Zann: Corrupting planets has many benefits.  Not only can we spy on the forces on a planet, but we are able to study the configuration of the land invasion map.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_92,Tyber Zann: We have failed in our first attempt at corrupting Mandalore.  Fortunately, we have received word that the Supreme Strategist will be making another trip to the Hutt base.  Take this Defiler to Mandalore and try again.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_93,Hint: Be advised that only Zann Consortium heroes are capable of purchasing technology from the black market.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_94,Tyber Zann: We don't want to give Jabba any warning.  Leave Mandalore under his control for now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_95,Urai Fen: We need to go into hiding quickly!  Attacking Mandalore would expose us.  We cannot afford that at this time.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_96,Urai Fen: It would be foolish to expose ourselves to the Imperials at Nal Hutta.  Let's get to Kamino and out of sight.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_97,Hint: Be sure to make use of the special abilities of your units.  Using those abilities could mean the difference between victory and defeat.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_98,Hint: Once a world has been corrupted, you will be unable to change the corruption type of that planet.  If the corruption is removed by enemy heroes, or the planet is conquered, you can re-corrupt it with whatever corruption choices are available.
TEXT_SPEECH_UNDERWORLD_TUTORIAL_99,Hint: The yellow fog surrounding the planets indicates that they are under the corruption influence of the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_UTAPAU_BRB_VICTORY_COR49_05,Defiler: Bribing those captains worked out well.  The thought of having those ships taken away frightened the planet officials.  They'll do as we say.
TEXT_SPEECH_UTAPAU_KID_LOAD_COR49_01,Silri: Another conquest for the Zann Consortium!
TEXT_SPEECH_UTAPAU_KID_LOSS_COR49_04,Silri: I thought they might give us trouble.  We know of their defenses now and cannot fail a second time.
TEXT_SPEECH_UTAPAU_KID_TACTICAL_COR49_02,Silri: The guards in the Fey compound are unusually powerful.  We'll focus on one point and fight our way through to grab Garnak Fey.
TEXT_SPEECH_UTAPAU_KID_VICTORY_COR49_03,Silri: We have the Fey family member in our control, and the planet will do anything to meet our demands.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_01,Tyber Zann: My stay in prison has not done wonders for the Zann Consortium.  Jabba must have already heard of my escape. We need to move quickly; is there anything left, Urai?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_02,Urai Fen: We have only a few outdated speeders.  Most of our associates deserted us once you were imprisoned.  What are your orders?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_03,Tyber Zann: We shall do as we've always done, Urai!  There are always worlds that are ripe for corruption.  Through Imperial and Rebellion planets we'll spread corruption, and rebuild the Zann Consortium into a crime network, that once again will be feared throughout the galaxy!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_04,Urai Fen: Then we will need Defilers. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_06,Defiler: Need something done?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_07,Tyber Zann: There's a remote Imperial colony on Honoghr...  If we start by subverting the Imperial officials there, it shouldn't attract undue attention.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_09,Tyber Zann: Word will soon spread that the Consortium is back.  I'm sure Jabba is aware of our movements; setting up a racketeering operation on Shola will let him know that we're back in business.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_16,Tyber Zann: Excellent!  Now that we've muscled in on Jabba's action, we have some credits to work with.  I've identified Mandal Hypernautics' supply shipments as an easy next target.  Hire some pirates to ambush them.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_17,Urai Fen: Why Mandal Hypernautics?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_18,Tyber Zann: I can only rely on my strategic intuition, so long Urai.  Raiding the supply ships will provide us better equipment, than what the Hutts are using.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_19,Urai Fen: ...and how will raiding their supply shipments gain you ships?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_20,Tyber Zann: If the Mandal supply ships are suddenly being raided, they'll need to take appropriate steps to ensure security...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_21,Tyber Zann: Now that our corruption has influenced a few worlds, we will realize a true criminal network. Once we link corrupted planets together,  we can bribe officials into allowing our ships, safe passage through enemy worlds
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G01_28,Tyber Zann: Of course we could set up a another racketeering operation there.  But I believe in order to truly make our make our mark, we need intimidation.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_01,Urai Fen: Soon after you escaped, I went to recover the artifact from its hiding place.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_02,Tyber Zann: Jabba must have given up half his criminal empire to buy that ancient puzzle.  I'll bet he expected to double his wealth by selling it to the Empire.  [Hearty Laughter]
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_03,Urai Fen: Even at twice his price, the Empire would have paid far too little.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_04,Tyber Zann: So you found out what it is?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_05,Urai Fen: I did gain some information.  The artifact dates as far back as the Sith Wars, making it around four thousand years old.  For such an artifact to be so well hidden for so long... it must contain a secret of great importance.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_06,Tyber Zann: Do you know its origin?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_07,Urai Fen: Based on the design, it is likely a Sith artifact.  I believe it may be a data storage device of some kind, but it also seems to serve another unknown purpose.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_08,Tyber Zann: Fascinating, Urai.  If we could unlock its secrets, we might find something very useful.  I want you to keep investigating, but not at the expense of our rebuilding.  I want Jabba, the Empire, everyone to know that the Zann Consortium is back.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_09,Urai Fen: Yes Tyber?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_10,Tyber Zann: Make them hurt.  We must let the galaxy know that Tyber Zann and his associates are back. Jabba's days are numbered and I want everyone else to know that as well. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G02_14,Tyber Zann: It's time I had a look at my prize.  I didn't go through torture at Jabba's hands and years of prison just to let it rot in its hiding place.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_01,Tyber Zann: While I was in prison, one of my cellmates mentioned that the emperor had a vast collection of treasure that he kept all over the galaxy in hidden vaults.  I...'persuaded' him to share more information with me.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_02,Urai Fen: Only an ex-Imperial officer would truly know that.  Did he mention the location of these vaults?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_03,Tyber Zann: I never found out, unfortunately.  I may have been a bit overzealous in my questioning.  He may not have known the locations of the vaults, but I'm convinced this story is more than just a rumor.  And now we have the perfect opportunity to test the story, thanks to the Rebels.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_04,Urai Fen: The Rebellion? 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_05,Tyber Zann: Alliance forces have destroyed the Imperial Death Star over Yavin 4.  Most Imperial battle stations carry data pods that are to be ejected during emergencies.  Perhaps...someone thought to follow protocol before the Death Star was destroyed?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_06,Urai Fen: And if the Rebels are still in the vicinity?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_07,Tyber Zann: The Rebels will be there.  They have an entire base on Yavin IV and have nowhere else to go.  The Empire will soon send a fleet to retaliate.  We must move quickly to find a data pod.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_11,Urai Fen: There are a few planets between us and Yavin that the Consortium does not control; what is their fate?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G03_12,Tyber Zann: Corrupt them.  Conquer them.  Be creative, Urai.  Just remember, that getting to Yavin is our goal.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_01,Tyber Zann: Well would you look at that.  I love it when I'm right.  [Sly Laughter]
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_02,Urai Fen: What have you found?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_03,Tyber Zann: Based on records of the emperor's transmissions, I believe the vaults are very real.  There are technical plans for new ships, and most importantly: construction schedules for the emperor's new flagship over Kuat.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_04,Urai Fen: It must be the largest in the Imperial fleet!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_05,Tyber Zann: Indeed it is.  According to this, the emperor has visited the ship under construction on many occasions.  If he was there, then it will have a link to his private files.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_06,Urai Fen: The vault locations will be there.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_07,Tyber Zann: Yes!  And with the wealth in those vaults, I can build a criminal empire that makes the Black Sun look like a swoop gang.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_08,Urai Fen: We will need to infiltrate the ship, then find a way into the emperor's private files.  It will not be easy.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_09,Tyber Zann: Details, Urai, details.  As long as the ship is there, I'm certain we can find our way onboard, and find what we're looking for.  But I'm not mounting a raid on Kuat until I know the ship is where it's supposed to be.  We'll need to verify its presence, somehow.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_10,Urai Fen: The black market on Kuat might have that information.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_11,Tyber Zann: I've been meaning to pick up some new tech for the soldiers on Kuat anyway.  Jabba's been too quiet lately.  He'll be paying us a visit soon.  I'd like to have a few 'surprises' ready for him.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_12,Defiler: I've located the Emperor's new flagship. It's being constructed in the Kuat shipyards, just as you suspected. The security forces around the site appear formidable.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G04_13,Tyber Zann: No security is infallible. Nobody rests in this organization until we've found a way in.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G05_03,Tyber Zann: Ah, disruptors, finally!  Disintegrates durasteel, wood, flesh, just about anything really.  Just the thing for removing large, troublesome obstacles.  Like Jabba, for instance.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G05_11,Tyber Zann: Remind me to check the black market on Rebel-controlled worlds as well.  They may have discovered weapons unknown to the Empire.  Hm.  It appears it will be very difficult getting onto that ship.  Wonderful name it has.  The 'Eclipse.'  It certainly blocked out my view of the shipyards.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G05_12,Urai Fen: Can we get in for a closer look?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G05_13,Tyber Zann: They have an armada of ships guarding that thing.  I doubt they're providing tour to the public.  Still, there must be a way.  I'll think of something.  I always do, Urai.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G05_14,Tyber Zann: Well done.  Now that our defilers have set up the black market, I can buy what I need.  And perhaps...learn more about the emperor's flagship.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_01,Zann Consortium Soldier: Our barracks have been destroyed!  We have reports of simultaneous bombing and sniper attacks from every sector!  The defenses at our main bases are holding, but the Consortium has taken heavy damage throughout the galaxy.  No word on who's behind the offensive.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_02,Tyber Zann: Jabba has now become a much bigger part of my plans.  I'll kill him, but I must make sure he has a chance to suffer.  He has struck first, which bothers me.  But I'll pay him back, at triple the cost!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_03,Jabba the Hutt: [Translated]  Tyber Zann.  How nice to see you again.  The look of surprise when the stormtroopers took you away is one of my fondest memories...  It was almost as enjoyable as picking over your little operation while you rotted in jail.  You must be a fool to steal from me again.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_04,Tyber Zann: Jabba!  Heh, how's the desert planet treating you?  Dried up and died yet?  No?  Well that's to bad!  Now get out of my comm system.  How did he find us here?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_05,Zann Consortium Soldier: We traced the signal to Saleucami.  Looks like Jabba maintains a small comm outpost there.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_06,Tyber Zann: I want control of that comm outpost so we can do a little eavesdropping of our own.  Saleucami needs to be softened up in preparation for our landing.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_07,Soldier: Right away!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_08,Tyber Zann: The shield generator is our target, take it out!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_09,Tyber Zann: I want this planet in my pocket.  Make it happen, Urai!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_10,Tyber Zann: Well done, Urai.  Lets find, and destroy Jabba's presence on this planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_14,Defiler: There's been another wave of attacks on our forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_15,Tyber Zann: Kill any of our surviving officers who may have  allowed this to happen and enlist new recruits.  The Zann Consortium will not tolerate weakness in our ranks.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G06_BOUNCE,Tyber Zann: Saleucami can wait, my attention is needed elsewhere.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_01,Tyber Zann: It seems Jabba has been digging up the past...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_02,Urai Fen: How so?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_03,Tyber Zann: According to data we recovered on Saleucami, Jabba's stumbled across an old battle droid factory on Hypori that somehow survived the Clone Wars.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_04,Urai Fen: The factory is still functional?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_05,Tyber Zann: My sources believe it is.  Jabba has been unable to get the factory operational.  I want control of it so I can begin manufacturing an invasion army of my own.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_06,Urai Fen: It could be a trap.  There's already a Hutt bounty on your head...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_07,Tyber Zann: As much as I doubt Jabba's intelligence, I do pay you to be cautious.  I'm sending you ahead of the main force to scout out the situation.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_11,Tyber Zann:  Urai, have you learned any more about our mysterious artifact?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_G07_12,Urai Fen: With more time I will unravel this mystery, Tyber.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_00,Han Solo: I hope you're right about these coordinates, Chewie...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_01,Han Solo: You said it buddy. Anyone willing to pay this much money for a spice run is probably looking to avoid Imperial trouble.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_02,Urai Fen: You have no need to worry, Captain Solo. My employer is an independent interest in this galactic conflict.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_03,Bounty Hunter: ...and you must be Tyber Zann.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_04,Tyber Zann: A bounty hunter.  How very appropriate.  I would tell you to send my regards to Jabba, but you won't get the chance.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_05,Bounty Hunter: I'll tell him when I pick up my bounty.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_06,Tyber Zann: You'd be smart to leave with your skin intact before the prison riot I've planned kicks off, which should be any moment now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_07,Bounty Hunter: I'll be gone by then.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_08,Tyber Zann: You're right.  Sooner than you thought.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_09,Tyber Zann: Perfect timing as usual, Urai.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_10,Urai Fen: We must move quickly to the landing site.  I had the power on your blaster upgraded while you were imprisoned.  It should prove very effective.  Come.  The Zann Consortium awaits your return.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_11,Tyber Zann: I've been here far too long already.  I assume you've arranged for a hasty departure?  This way!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_12,Han Solo: Hold on a second, where's my cargo?  And what's with all these people?  I'm not running a passenger ship!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_13,Tyber Zann: Urai, explain things to the prisoners. Their usefulness is at an end.  
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_14,Urai Fen: Consider it done. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_15,Tyber Zann: I'm your cargo, Captain Solo.  Don't worry about the prisoners.  They found their way in here, they can find their own way out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_16,Han Solo: Whoa, wait a minute.  Your man said this was just a spice run.  Now, of course I never believed that nonsense about a spice run but I didn't count on an Imperial prison riot!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_17,Tyber Zann: I'll double your already considerable fee.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_18,Han Solo: I know Chewie.  I get the feeling we don't have much choice if we want to leave here with our skins attached; get aboard now, we're leaving!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_19,Tyber Zann: Let's go, Urai.  We need to re-establish our criminal network as soon as possible.  With Jabba posting a bounty on my head, every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be out to stop us.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_20,Tyber Zann: Perhaps some of our comrades can make themselves useful in getting past that turret. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_21,Tyber Zann: Stay clear of those, if you don't like explosions.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_22,Tyber Zann: Those look valuable.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_23,Tyber Zann: I'll take them all, thank you.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_24,Tyber Zann: I have a ship waiting nearby, follow me!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_25,Tyber Zann: This way, all of you!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_26,Tyber Zann: The only way you'll be free is to follow my lead. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_27,Prisoner: Let's get out of here!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_28,Prisoner: Lead the way!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_29,Prisoner: Finally.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_30,Prisoner: Tyber has escaped!  Head for the gates!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_31,Tyber Zann: Come with me men, and the Zann Consortium will rule once more!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_32,Tyber Zann: Remind me to repay Jabba for his 'kindness' once I...once we get out of here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_33,Urai Fen: Wait.  There are some droids up ahead that may cause us problems.  I will go ahead, and take them out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_34,Tyber Zann: Nonsense; send the prisoners!  It's not as if I intend to bring them with us on the ship...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_35,Han Solo: I'm not waiting around for the Imperial fleet to get here, make it snappy!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_36,Han Solo: Yeah, well...  Keep the engines warm.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_37,Tyber Zann: So Jabba sends a Bounty Hunter into my cell to finish me off huh? If you manage to kill me the Consortium will make sure you'd never collect a single credit. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_38,Bounty Hunter: There's nothing left of your Consortium
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_39,Tyber Zann: Still enough to take care of one bounty hunter. On time, old friend, as expected.  
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_40,Han Solo: There're some stormtroopers here wondering why I'm not loading cargo.  You better hurry up or I'm leaving...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_41,Han Solo: I didn't believe that story about the spice run but I never signed up for a prison break!  Lets get out of here!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_42,Han Solo: You're not paying me enough for this.  I'm in space in two minutes, with or without you.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_43,Urai Fen: There is much opposition between us and the ship.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_44,Tyber Zann: Not as many as there would have been if I hadn't poisoned their water supply earlier.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_45,Tyber Zann: That should give the guards something else to shoot at.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_46,Han Solo: It's never a good idea to sneak up on a nervous smuggler this close to an Imperial prison. If I'm startled I might shoot first.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_47,Jabba the Hutt: [Translated]  Ho, ho, ho, Tyber Zann, my old business partner!  How do you like the accommodations I arranged for you?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_48,Tyber Zann: Visiting hours are over, Jabba.  If you're looking for your stolen artifact, don't worry.  I've got it in safekeeping.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_49,Jabba the Hutt: [Translated]  Then it will remain there forever.  Your Consortium and its contacts are no more, thanks to me.  You will rot in this prison, at least until I can send someone to put you out of your misery.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_50,Tyber Zann: Please send an associate to pay me a visit, I need the company!  You'll still never find your lost ancient artifact.  What a shame.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_51,Jabba the Hutt: [Translated]  You have stolen something very valuable from me, so I in turn have taken everything from you.  You have made a grave error in taking my precious artifact, I have come to offer you one last chance to tell me where you have hidden it and I will let you live.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_52,Tyber Zann: The artifact now belongs to me.  You can forget about getting it back.  You may think you've wiped out the Consortium, but my reach is farther than you think.  You are the one who should be watching your back, Jabba!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_53,Jabba the Hutt: [Translated]  I thought you would respond with impotent threats.  One way or another, I'll find the artifact.  The bounty I've placed on your head will make for an interesting, if not exciting, stay in prison.  The good news is your sentence will not be a long one.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_54,Tyber Zann: Urai, come in at once.  Do you read me?  Urai!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_55,Urai Fen: Urai, here.  We are in system, as planned.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_56,Tyber Zann: I'm accelerating our plans.  Jabba has sent some of his lackeys to finish the job he couldn't.  Get that ship landed now.  I'll set things in motion here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_57,Urai Fen: Captain Solo wanted more time to slip past the Imperial defenses.  I believe I can motivate him with additional credits.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_58,Tyber Zann: We need to make sure that neither Jabba nor the Empire has discovered the location of our hidden palace on Ryloth.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_59,Urai Fen: There has been no unusual activity near Ryloth.  The Hutts are unaware of our palace there, and the Imperials have extended themselves trying to quell the Rebellion.  We will be able to expand our operations quickly upon your return.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_60,Tyber Zann: The partnership with Jabba was a mistake.  No more alliances.  We're going to do this our way.  We'll corrupt planets one by one, and crush all those who oppose us!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_61,Han Solo: Chewie, get the Falcon ready, we're leaving!  We didn't sign up for this!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_62,Tyber Zann: Captain, I'm very sorry. I understand your concern, but that's the problem with good help like my lieutenant - by the time I can get a word out to stop him, he's already finished. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_63,Han Solo: When we get out of Imperial space, you're on your own. I never heard of you.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_64,Tyber Zann: I'll bribe these fools to aid in my escape.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_65,Han Solo:  It's about time you guys showed up.  Look, your man Urai here, didn't say anything about springing prisoners.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_66,Tyber Zann:  I'm already free of my bonds, Captain Solo, as you can plainly see.  How this transpired is none of your concern. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_67,Tyber Zann:  I know you have been inconvenienced, and I am prepared to compensate you.  Shall we say... double your original fee?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M01_68,Urai Fen:  I have let you live this long, Captain Solo.  Perhaps I should reconsider?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_00,Zann Consortium Pilot: We've scanned the outer area.  No sign of enemy fleet movements.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_01,Tyber Zann: As I expected.  I want a thorough search of that debris field, take anything of worth but do it quickly.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_02,Pilot: What now?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_03,Tyber Zann: Let's make a final pass, there must be something worthwhile here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_04,Zann Consortium Pilot: Looks like Rebel ships incoming!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_05,Rebel Ship: Identify yourselves!  Send your transponder codes now!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_06,Tyber Zann: Engage the Rebels, we need to buy more time!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_07,Tyber Zann: That may very well be an emergency data pod from the Death Star.  Retrieve it.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_08,Tyber Zann: Another data pod!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_09,Tyber Zann: There's another data pod.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_10,Tyber Zann: That's enough!  We have what we came for, prepare to jump to hyperspace!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_11,Wedge Antilles: Unidentified ships: you are trespassing in Alliance space.  Surrender immediately, and prepare to be boarded!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_12,Tyber Zann: Surrender isn't in an option.  Let our enemies fight each other.  Stay focused on those data pods.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_13,Wedge Antilles: Red 2 to all Alliance units: we need to regroup for another strike, we're losing too many fighters!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_14,Tyber Zann: Oh, look.  The little Rebels are deploying defensive satellites.  Do not let their toys interfere with our operation!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_15,Pirate Ship: This is not your fight.  Move along or we'll add you to the scrap!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_16,Tyber Zann: Brush these insects off, leave them for the Rebels!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_17,Imperial Ship: Pirates inbound!  Maintain the defensive perimeter, we need more time for repairs!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_18,Tyber Zann: Amusing.  Imperial vessels licking their wounds.  I wonder how that fits into the emperor's 'grand vision...'
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_19,Tartan Commander: There's the code phrase.  Switch your transponders and fall in with Zann's forces.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_20,Imperial Ship: Mutinous traitors!  Lord Vader will hear of this!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_21,Tyber Zann: Welcome aboard, gentlemen.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_22,Pirate Vessel: Too slow, Zann!  You want this, you'll have to pay for it!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_23,Tyber Zann: What insolence!  That vessel has a data pod, do not let it escape!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_24,Pilot: Incoming hyperspace signature! Whatever it is, it's massive. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_25,Tyber Zann: That would be the inevitable Imperial fleet.  Ah.  Here is their transmission now:
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_26,Imperial Commander: All surviving Imperial forces: regroup, and reinforce the blockade.  Eliminate all remaining vessels.  No one leaves here alive.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_27,Tyber Zann: We're no match for that destroyer.  Prepare to evacuate the system!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_28,Tyber Zann: The pirate has dropped the data pod!  Retrieve it immediately!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_29,Rebel Commander: We've got scavengers on our tail – protect the shuttles at all costs!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_30,Tyber Zann: Hmm... Rebel forces evacuating Yavin. Might be worth a change in plans. Detain the shuttles, confiscate anything worthwhile, and destroy the rest.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_31,Tyber Zann: Scans indicate that wreckage has high mineral value. Inspect the debris and retrieve anything of worth.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_32,Tyber Zann: This one is just useless chatter between the Grand Moffs.  Look for another.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_33,Tyber Zann: Hold on...this one details a new warship!  I've never seen such an ambitious design...apart from the Death Star.  It's apparently under construction at the Kuat shipyards.  Interesting.  Lets keep collecting data pods.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_34,Tyber Zann: Looks like this one contains some information about the emperor's archive.  Fascinating.  Keep looking for more pods around.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_BOUNCE,Tyber Zann: I want to oversee this mission personally.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M02_FAIL,Tyber Zann: Failure is unacceptable.  We'll be better prepared next time.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_01,Zann Consortium Soldier: No reports of outgoing transports...nowhere to hide...what is this?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_02,Urai Fen: Jabba will be planning an ambush.  Expect resistance at the landing site.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_03,Zann Consortium Soldier: We've got a...disturbance...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_04,Urai Fen: This was expected.  Maintain defenses here, I will re-establish a reinforcement point.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_05,Hutt Soldier: There he is, just like Jabba warned!  An infiltrator!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_06,Urai Fen: Whether Jabba warned you or not is of no consequence.  Stand down, or be eliminated.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_07,Hutt Soldier: Double pay for the one who takes his head!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M03_08,Urai Fen: The reinforcement point is ours, bring in all remaining ground forces!  Remember, we need that comm station intact!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_00,Urai Fen: You have brought help. A wise decision.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_01,Tyber Zann: Why, Urai... are you expecting trouble?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_02,Urai Fen: I would be foolish to expect otherwise.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_03,Tyber Zann: That looks like the control station.  Let's get this factory shut down before anything else happens.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_04,Tyber Zann: The droids must be using those nodes to travel underground
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_05,Tyber Zann: They're coming from somewhere!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_06,Urai Fen: I have managed to set the factory to manual, so we should have no more surprises.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_07,Tyber Zann: ...you were saying?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_08,Jabba the Hutt: [Translated]  Ho, ho, ho...  An insignificant thief like you only has so many chances, Tyber Zann.  Your chances have just run out.  It is good to know that I will soon have back my stolen artifact...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_09,Tyber Zann: Not so insignificant that I can't steal your most precious and valuable artifact.  Now I control your little droid factory.  Admit it, Jabba.  You've been beaten.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_10,Jabba the Hutt: [Translated]  The game is not over, Tyber!  I knew you were coming, and I thought I would let you clean out the droids for me.  You have my thanks.  Now, you can die!  Kill them all!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_11,Tyber Zann: I'm sure Jabba's not paying enough for the services of a bounty hunter of...your expertise.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_12,Bossk: [Translated]  It's never enough...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_13,Tyber Zann: Indeed.  Hmph.  What would you say if I tripled Jabba's payment, and delivered it...in advance?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_14,Bossk: [Translated]  Where's the target?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_15,Tyber Zann: Jabba: your men are dead and you're surrounded.  I'd say that puts you at a disadvantage.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_16,Jabba the Hutt: [Translated]  We can make a deal, Tyber!  There's no need to do anything...permanent.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_17,Tyber Zann: The only deal that lets you live is this: the price on my head, gone.  The hits on my territories, stop.  The planets Saleucami and Hypori, now belong to me.  If I see your people anywhere in my territory, I'll personally come to Tatooine, and feed you to your own rancor!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_18,Jabba the Hutt: [Translated]  Agreed.  Just leave Hutt territory alone, and I will leave you to your business.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_19,Tyber Zann: Oh, of course, Jabba.  As long as you live, I will leave you to your holdings.  Now, get off my planet!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_20,Urai Fen: It might be better to simply finish him now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_21,Tyber Zann: Now is not the time for a war with the Hutt cartel. Soon we will have the resources to crush Jabba and the Hutts once and for all. For now he is not an imminent threat.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_22,Urai Fen: I have to get to the controls and deactivate these droids!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_23,Tyber Zann: There are the controls!  Quickly, shut this thing down!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_24,Tyber Zann: Destroyer droids!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_25,Tyber Zann: I have a bad feeling about this.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_26,Urai Fen: Droids!  
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_27,Urai Fen: Those turrets are active!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_28,Urai Fen: I must reach the backup systems!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_29,Urai Fen: If I can get this factory operational again, the droids can be reprogrammed to fight for us!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_30,Tyber Zann: Go!  I'll hold 'em off!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_31,Urai Fen: Protect the droid nodes!  They should prove useful.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_32,Tyber Zann: We've got to recapture those landing platforms or we'll never get our cargo out of here!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_33,Tyber Zann: We're losing droid nodes fast!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_34,Tyber Zann: Don't just stand there!  Capture that landing platform!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_35,Urai Fen: It would be best to forget that option. They are magnetically sealed. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_36,Tyber Zann: It's no use. Those doors are magnetically sealed.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_37,Tyber Zann: We'll have to find another way around.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_38,Urai Fen: We cannot open those doors until the power is shut down. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_39,Tyber Zann: Landing zone captured.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_40,Tyber Zann: We got one landing zone.  There's three more!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_41,Tyber Zann: Halfway there...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_42,Tyber Zann: Just need to take one more...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_43,Tyber Zann: We've taken them all.  Now what?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_44,Tyber Zann: I don't know how to use this thing.  Urai get over here!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_45,Urai Fen: I will need one minute to complete this. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_46,Tyber Zann: We might not have a minute; hurry it up!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_47,Urai Fen: Tyber, I have rerouted the systems in the Droid Works.  We now have complete control over the destroyer droids.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_48,Tyber Zann: We can't defeat these droids!  We've got to get to the controls!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_49,Tyber Zann: Is the factory...open for business?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_50,Urai Fen: The emergency defenses are active.  The droids will pursue us until I can shut them down.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_51,Tyber Zann: Can we get to the shutoff controls?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_52,Urai Fen: They are deep within the factory.  We can reach them, if we avoid any unnecessary conflicts.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_53,Tyber Zann: Backing down from a fight?  Urai... Don't tell me you've grown soft while I've been away.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_54,Urai Fen: I said nothing about backing down; we likely won't have that option.  Droidekas are fast.  Very fast.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_55,Urai Fen: The battle-class droideka is 1.83 meters in height, and has a built in shield projector making it a formidable threat to infantry, and light vehicles.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_56,Tyber Zann: I've never encountered one myself, but I've heard the stories...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_57,Urai Fen: ...it has twin rapid-fire blaster cannons...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_58,Tyber Zann: ...meaning, you don't want to be up against a mob of these things?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_59,Urai Fen: Exactly.  This model is also equipped with ion blasters, allowing them to cripple shielded units.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_60,Tyber Zann: That kind of versatility could prove useful.  Are we at the controls yet?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_61,Urai Fen: We should be near.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_62,HINT: Prices have changed in the black market.  Visit Imperial and Rebel worlds to see what's available.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_63,Tyber Zann: Ending this feud with Jabba allows me to concentrate on bigger fish.  Our influence is spreading, Urai.  My defeat of Jabba allows me to take on my true enemy.  The Empire.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_64,Urai Fen: What about the forces of the Rebellion?  Their power is growing.  They could prove a useful ally. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT01_M04_65,Tyber Zann: What do I care for their cause?  They've done nothing for me!  I'll play both sides; no one is doing us any favors, so they'll get none in return!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_01,Urai Fen: Between Jabba, the Empire, and your quest for information about the Sith artifact, we may be overextending our capabilities.  Furthermore, I have heard reports of insubordination among our Defilers.  The situation seems very dangerous.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_02,Tyber Zann: Urai, where there is power, there are always threats and dissentions.  We will deal with them accordingly.  I suspect there is great power in that Sith artifact, something that might give us the advantage we need to rebuild the Zann Consortium.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_03,Tyber Zann: I've heard the same whispers regarding our Defilers.  I won't have our secret base above Ryloth compromised.  Add another layer of brain washing to their training regiment.  I want to ensure their loyalty.  Urai, you know I have always trusted your wisdom in these matters.  Ignore these distractions and move forward as planned.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_04,Urai Fen: Have we found any weaknesses in the blockade at Kuat?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_05,Tyber Zann: The Imperial forces are not going to stop me.  But they've certainly slowed my progress.  Our answers lie within the Eclipse but I still see no way to reach it, given its defenses.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_06,Urai Fen: In time, a weakness will reveal itself. Perhaps we should shift our focus to the artifact?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_07,Tyber Zann: You said that it was a Sith creation, yes?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_08,Urai Fen: Yes.  A data storage device.  Perhaps more.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_09,Tyber Zann: What do we need to access it?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_10,Urai Fen: Knowledge of the extinct Sith ways.  Someone who could manipulate the dark side of the Force.  Someone with that ability would be very rare, difficult to track down, and approach.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G08_11,Tyber Zann: Darth Vader may be the only known Sith Lord in existence, and I...doubt he'd be cooperative.  If another with this knowledge exists, I need you to find them and enlist them to assist us.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_01,Urai Fen: It seems that things are going according to plan, Tyber.  Our pirates at Mandalore report that Mandal Hypernautics is trying to buy a cease-fire with new ships.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_02,Tyber Zann: Excellent!  Tell the pirates to cut a deal: 'cease hostilities in exchange for new ships,' at a reasonable price of course...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_03,Chairman: You leave them out of this Zann. I'm calling to get help. We've lost three shipments to pirates in our system. You will get your ships the moment they are scrubbed clean from my skies. And if you ever touch my family I'll see you dead.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_04,Tyber Zann: We're business partners. But you have to understand the cost of doing business with the Zann Consortium. Why haven't your corporate fleets destroyed these pirates?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_05,Chairman: It would be bad for business - some of the pirates are our best customers.  Besides. if we were to reveal the true size of our navy, the Emperor would start paying more attention to who our clients are.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_06,Tyber Zann: I could easily slaughter these pirates. Of course, everything has it's price. If I clean up your problem, what's in it for me besides the ships I already expect? 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_07,Chairman: I'm sure some kind of compensation could be arranged...perhaps first rights to our newest products?  I might even be able to arrange a discount of some kind.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_08,Tyber Zann: Then we are in agreement. I'll destroy the pirates and expect your delivery shortly. Over and out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_09,Urai Fen: I will see that it is done.  Also, the pirate captain sent over one of the ships.  Curious...  Why did he not keep it for himself?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_10,Tyber Zann: That should be obvious, Urai: fear.  My reputation is spreading deep into the galaxy, and the captain knows well what would happen if he tried to steal from me.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_11,Urai Fen: I see.  Well at least we won't have to actually pay them now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_13,Chairman: You are a man of your word.  Our newest corvette has just finished production - the Crusader-class.  I'd like you to have one as my gift.  Our shipyards and factories are always open for your business.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G09_14,Tyber Zann: You may want to call home, Chairman.  Poor little Amelia has just had a terrible experience. It seems someone has just shot out the eyes of her new birthday pony while she was riding it. Over and out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_01,Urai Fen: I think I have located a potential source of dark side Force-users for you.  There is, however, a complication.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_02,Tyber Zann: Someone stands in our way?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_03,Urai Fen: The planet Dathomir holds many Force-users of great power.  However, the emperor found it before we did.  He has blockaded the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_04,Tyber Zann: I see.  No need to confront the Empire head-on there.  We're better off sneaking into the planet with a small force, and taking what we want under their noses.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_05,Urai Fen: It may be possible to land undetected, but the sensors on the planet are very good.  We will soon be detected, unless we disable the Empire's sensor web.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_06,Tyber Zann: Send for some Defilers.  We'll have them sabotage the sensor system, and then we'll take the shuttle down ourselves.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_12,Tyber Zann: The way is clear.  Let's go, Urai.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G10_17,Tyber Zann: Urai, this mission is for you and I alone.  Just like old times.  The Empire is watching this planet too carefully.  We need to move swiftly and undercover.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_01,Urai Fen: Tyber, you have an incoming transmission on your private channel.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_02,Tyber Zann: Impossible!  How did you find me!?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_03,Thrawn: Of course I was aware you had taken Jabba's comm node on Saleucami; tapping into it to reach you was trivial.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_04,Tyber Zann: I shouldn't be surprised that you were able to track me down.  I see you've risen quickly in the Imperial ranks.  With the way the Empire treats non-humans, I'm surprised you're not commanding a garbage scow somewhere...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_05,Thrawn: My capabilities have proven more than enough to inspire the emperor's tolerance.  Ironic, that you were once one of the Academy's most promising students.  Now, you're an outcast.  And foolish enough to try and pay your way by attacking Imperial holdings.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_06,Tyber Zann: I took nothing the Empire wasn't going to lose to the Rebels anyway.  Watch me too closely Thrawn, and you will not like what I have to show you!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_07,Thrawn: A clumsy threat, Tyber.  And an empty one.  You may be king among your little cadre of bandits, but you will soon provoke a response beyond your capacity to comprehend.  Consider this warning a courtesy from an old friend...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_08,Tyber Zann: Your crumbling Empire, and its aging admirals may find they have their hands full with the Zann Consortium this time around, Thrawn.  You'd think a tactical genius such as yourself would see that coming?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G11_09,Thrawn: What I see is a petty criminal who will be destroyed the moment he rises from the sludge and attracts the attention of the Empire!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_01,Silri: I have translated the characters on the artifact as you asked.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_02,Tyber Zann: Have you?  Please...  Enlighten me.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_03,Silri: It appears to be an ancient star map, including hyperspace travel vectors.  Unfortunately, the artifact only lists territories already mapped centuries ago.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_04,Tyber Zann: Seems every Sith artifact in existence is some sort of ancient star map, doesn't it Urai?  Worthless.  Perhaps I can find a gullible buyer with deep pockets.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_05,Silri: I wish to study it further.  I found the artifact holds little in the way of useful information, but it could be useful for translating other Sith texts.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_06,Tyber Zann: We may know it's useless, but I intend to find a buyer that doesn't.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_07,Silri: Its information might yet yield great power!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_08,Tyber Zann: I will contact you should I decide to make further use of it.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_09,Silri: So be it...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_10,Urai Fen: She looked as though she was ready to kill you.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G12_11,Tyber Zann: Think nothing of it, Urai.  Dathomir witches always look as if they're ready to kill.  Keep an eye on her.  This artifact is the only leverage I have over her, and I want her kept on a short leash.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_01,Urai Fen: Tyber, you have an incoming transmission.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_02,Tyber Zann: Xizor!  How good to see you again!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_03,Xizor: You address me as an equal, Zann.  I assure you, we are not.  I contact you only because of that Sith artifact you possess.  I was going to broker the original deal with Jabba and the Empire.  Before you stole it.  Your interference cost me a great deal.  I assume it is still in your possession?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_04,Tyber Zann: You're in luck, Xizor!  I do indeed have the very thing you speak of.  You know, I've heard the emperor is a collector of such Sith antiquities, perhaps you could put me in touch with him?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_05,Xizor: I could be persuaded to put you in contact with the emperor...or at least, one of his representatives.  But you'll need to do something for me, first.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_06,Tyber Zann: Of course, good Prince.  What service could a simple man, such as myself, provide?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_07,Xizor: There is a job I need done on Bespin.  Specifically, I wish for you to procure a shipment of tibanna gas.  Succeed, and you get half the gas, plus your Imperial contact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_08,Tyber Zann: A pleasure, Prince Xizor.  And of course, I would not insult you by mentioning what would happen should I be double crossed?  This shouldn't take long.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_09,Urai Fen: I do not trust Xizor.  It must be a trap.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_10,Tyber Zann: Of course.  But Xizor's made the mistake of setting his trap on the planet Bespin.  That world is under the personal control of Darth Vader.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_11,Urai Fen: And how would that help our cause?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_12,Tyber Zann: Xizor is clearly hoping to get us killed, so that he can claim the artifact and give it to the emperor himself.  Since Xizor and Vader already have a long-standing feud, we just need to take the gas and plant enough evidence pointing directly at Xizor's little, green head.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_13,Urai Fen: Xizor takes the fall, we get the gas, and keep the artifact.  An excellent plan.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_14,Tyber Zann: And most importantly, we gain access to the Imperial security network.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_15,Urai Fen: How do we accomplish that?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_16,Tyber Zann: I know just the droid who can interface with the Bespin facility's computers.  Are you familiar with a droid bounty hunter known as IG-88?  He has a rather impressive list of accomplishments.  Find him.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_17,Urai Fen: I will contact him.  He owes me a favor, consider it done.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_18,Tyber Zann: Oh, and Urai?  Have the boys see if they can pick up some Imperial ships through the usual channels.  I'm going to need them soon.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G13_20,Tyber Zann: It will take both Urai, and I to get the tibanna gas.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G14_02,Xizor: It seems I misjudged you, Zann.  Stealing that tibanna gas from Vader must have been very difficult.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G14_03,Tyber Zann: You neglected to mention Vader's presence...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G14_04,Xizor: Merely a test to see if you were smart enough to do your research!  You passed.  Now then, I will be happy to arrange your meeting with the Empire.  I'll send you the rendezvous coordinates, and details soon.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_01,Urai Fen: I see you kept a large portion of the Tibanna gas; you have plans for it?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_02,Tyber Zann: I've blackmailed some engineers to start production on the ship designs we scavenged from the wreckage of the Death Star.  We'll use the tibanna gas for the hyperdrives and weapon systems.  The first of the new ships should be ready now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_03,Urai Fen: The Vengeance Frigate.  An interesting design.  And the other ship?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_04,Tyber Zann: The other design will be my flagship, but it will take more time to complete.  Once it is?  We'll find a suitable opponent to test its capabilities.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_05,Urai Fen: Do we really want to create yet another enemy?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_06,Tyber Zann: We'll play one force against another. Which is why I asked you to get those Imperial ships.  We're going to flush them out using Imperial ships and Vader's codes.  The Rebels will think the Empire is after them and flee, never to return.  We get the asteroids for our production facility, and the Empire gets to think they destroyed yet another Rebel cell.  Everyone is happy!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_07,Urai Fen: Except the Rebels of course. I would not want to have you for an enemy.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_08,Tyber Zann: True...  Oh, and remember to hide those ships in some out of the way spot after the battle - They'll be too hot to use for a bit.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_10,Rebel Pilot: Sir! Incoming Imperial taskforce!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_11,Urai Fen: Excellent - Tyber's plan is working perfectly.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G15_12,Urai Fen: This mission is under my command - it cannot begin without my presence.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_01,Urai Fen: Tyber, we've received rendezvous coordinates from Prince Xizor.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_02,Tyber Zann: Have we, now?  That is quite interesting.  Well then, we shouldn't keep our Imperial friends waiting.  Invite Bossk to come along, would you?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_03,Urai Fen: Why Bossk?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_04,Tyber Zann: I have a job for him.  Though, he doesn't know it yet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_05,Silri: You should not take the artifact into Empire-controlled space, are you mad!?  Whatever your plans, this must be a trap!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_06,Tyber Zann: Your concern...is touching.  And besides, why would it matter to you?  It's just a worthless old map, isn't it?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_07,Silri: That artifact is important to my clan, the Nightsisters!  I've told you I wish to study it further; it would be a terrible mistake to let it fall into Imperial hands!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_08,Urai Fen: It is not your place to question Tyber.  Be silent, or I will personally introduce you to my blades; a task I will find most satisfying.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_09,Silri: Your blades will meet my whip.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_10,Tyber Zann: Enough!  I have a business to run!  I don't need distractions right now.  Once we have the emperor's vaults, feel free to kill each other.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_G16_11,Silri: This is not over...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_00,Tyber Zann: What a cheerful location...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_01,Urai Fen: We must be cautious.  This planet resonates with the power of the dark side.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_02,Tyber Zann: Why, Urai!  Did you become a Jedi Knight while I was in prison?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_03,Urai Fen: My people are not Jedi or Sith.  But our existence has always been tied to the Force.  We are aware of its presence.  It is strong here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_04,Tyber Zann: I'm a bit disturbed that you've kept this from me, old friend.  Although it doesn't surprise me that you have some Force awareness.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_05,Urai Fen: I understand.  It is something I rarely speak of.  The power of the Force on this world could be a threat if it were ever unleashed.  The Empire's interest in Dathomir is now apparent.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_06,Tyber Zann: Very well.  Let's find someone who can use it to open the artifact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_07,Silri: It is painful to see a trusted friend locked in this cell.  You will open the door now.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_08,Tyber Zann: Urai, if she tries that mind-control trick again, shoot her.  Silri, I assume?  We're not nearly the weak minded fools you take us for, though I am willing to open this door on my terms.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_09,Silri: Do not taunt me!  When I'm free of this cell, you'll be the second one I kill, no matter the cost!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_10,Tyber Zann: Now, now, now, you'll get out.  As long as you give me a reason to release you.  Do you know what this is?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_11,Silri: A Sith creation...  If it is real it must be very ancient, where did you get it?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_12,Tyber Zann: Where or whom I got it from doesn't matter.  Can you access the information stored inside?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_13,Silri: I...could.  Given time.  But I would demand more than just my freedom in payment.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_16,Tyber Zann: Name your price.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_17,Silri: I'll need transport off this planet in order to gather the needed resources.  I ask one other thing: revenge on my captor!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_18,Urai Fen: Do not trust her, Tyber.  Even now, she is reaching out to you with the dark side, prying at your defenses...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_19,Tyber Zann: I'm not concerned about our lovely Silri, Urai.  For now, at least.  Our goals are mutually beneficial.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_20,Silri: Understood.  Now, release me from this cell and we'll go to kill the Imperial governor that put me on display in this cage!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_21,Silri: That is the Imperial governor's stronghold!  His lifeless body will send a message to the emperor: the use of dark Force powers against his army should convince the emperor it would be wise to leave Dathomir!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_22,Imperial Governor: Wait, please!  I'm worth more to you alive!  Your message will get out through my ransom!  Your demands will be met!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_23,Silri: My message will be sent.  Written in your blood!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_24,Tyber Zann: There, now.  That worked out well for you.  Now it is time for you to hold up your end of the bargain.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_25,Silri: ...I will unlock the secrets of the artifact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_26,Urai Fen: This is a mistake, Tyber.  She will betray you as soon as she gets what she wants.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_27,Tyber Zann: This is a chance we have to take.  She can access the artifact and uncover its secrets.  Once my plans are set in motion, you can have the pleasure of killing her...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_28,Prison Guard: Kill her before she reaches the Rancor!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_29,Prison Guard: It's too late!  Run!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_30,Nightsister: Now - Feel my wrath!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_31,Tyber Zann: These women interest me. If we could release them, and enlist them against the Empire... 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_32,Urai Fen: We should avoid these rancor, for now.  They may prove useful when we free some of the prisoners.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_33,Tyber Zann: The sensors in those guard towers won't be fooled by our cloaking fields.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_34,Urai Fen: There is a saying among my people: 'Do not fight through the shell, when you can cut through the underbelly.'  There may be a backdoor to the complex, that will necessitate much less bloodshed.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_35,Tyber Zann: Looks like a path that leads towards the back of the prison complex...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_36,Urai Fen: Once we're inside the complex, it would be wise to shutdown power to the automated defenses.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_37,Tyber Zann: Our cloaking fields should get us past the patrols.  Let's take out the power, then we'll be clear to take out the prison.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_38,Nightsister: Why have you released us?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_39,Tyber Zann: We see that there is no love lost between your people and the Empire. We may have more in common that it appears. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_40,Urai Fen: If you help us, we will fight to free your sisters from every prison on the planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_41,Nightsister: The Empire will pay for wrongfully imprisoning us.  Bring us to rancor and we'll bring the Imperial forces to their knees!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_42,Urai Fen: Those guns will tear us apart if we do not disable them.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_43,Tyber Zann: Guns that large have to be drawing more power than the prison can produce, that dam we passed earlier might be their power source!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_54,Tyber Zann: Do you recognize this artifact?  I could reward you handsomely for unlocking it.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_55,Nightsister: The object is of Sith creation.  Only the most learned and powerful in the dark ways of the Force could hope to break its ancient code.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_56,Tyber Zann: And!?  Who would be the most powerful among you?  Is there one who could do this?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_57,Nightsister: Silri can be found in the Frenzied River Prison to the north.  The Imperial governor placed her in a cage and broadcast news of her imprisonment planet-wide in order to break our spirit.  It didn't work.  We rebelled, but many of our number were captured and imprisoned all over the planet.  The Empire is now our mortal enemy.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M06_SAB_BOUNCE,Tyber Zann: We need to destroy the orbital sensor array before we can approach Dathomir; trying to land would be suicide otherwise.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_00,Stormtrooper: Your arrival isn't on my schedule.  Let me see your identification papers.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_01,Tyber Zann: You don't need to see my identification.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_02,Stormtrooper: This one thinks he's a Jedi.  And why don't I need to see your identification?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_03,Tyber Zann: Because...  You're dead.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_04,Tyber Zann: We don't have much time.  I'll plant the evidence against Xizor, Urai, see to the tibanna gas.  IG-88, slice into the Imperial computer banks, and get me security access for all of the planets on my hit list.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_05,Urai Fen: Each tibanna gas collection facility is surrounded by four refineries.  I will need to escort the gas droids to the refineries, where they will procure the gas.  We will need to return with eight full droids for this mission to be a success.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_06,IG-88: I'll find the needed planetary security codes by hacking into Bespin's central server cluster.  It should only take a few nanoseconds.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_07,Tyber Zann: In order to make this look like a Black Sun operation, I'll need to sneak into the four security outposts and plant information that leaves no doubt that Xizor alone was behind the theft of the tibanna gas.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_08,Tyber Zann: One outpost down.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_09,Tyber Zann: That's two...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_10,Tyber Zann: One outpost left.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_11,Tyber Zann: That should leave no doubt in Darth Vader's mind that Xizor was responsible for this break in.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_12,IG-88: Cluster located.  Proximity required for access.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_13,IG-88: Accessing data...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_14,IG-88: Security reroute complete.  Tyber Zann now has access to restricted planets.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_15,Gas Cargo Droid: Acquiring gas...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_16,Gas Cargo Droid: Gas canister full.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_17,Gas Cargo Droid: Transferring gas...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_18,Gas Cargo Droid: Transfer successful.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_20,Tyber Zann: Urai, protect the droids!  If you keep losing droids, this mission will be a complete failure.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_21,Tyber Zann: You've managed to lose all the droids, there's no way to collect the gas now!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_22,Urai Fen: Tyber, we've collected enough gas.  All droids are returning to the shuttle.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_24,Zann Consortium Soldier: ...what appears to be Lord Vader's shuttle is on approach for landing at your location!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_25,Tyber Zann: We're going to have to move quickly on our final task if we want to get out of here intact!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_26,Imperial Field Commander: Sir, a group of smugglers have infiltrated our tibanna gas refinery.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_27,Darth Vader: You have, of course, captured and detained them?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_28,Imperial Field Commander: My Lord, we nearly had them, but they seem to have--  [Choking]
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_29,Darth Vader: Not the performance I expect from an Imperial Field Commander. I will seek them out myself.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_30,Tyber Zann: Good work.  Let's get back to the shuttle and get out of here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_31,Darth Vader: ...your report?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_32,Stormtrooper: They escaped with a large supply of tibanna gas; enough to supply a sizable fleet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_33,Darth Vader: ...have they been identified?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_34,Stormtrooper: We've found evidence that suggests the Black Sun criminal organization was responsible.  We also have records that indicate some of the local militia took bribes to allow them to land.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_35,Darth Vader: Execute the local militia and any associates.  Xizor will pay for this transgression.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_36,Tyber Zann: Lets go!  Get those droids unloaded!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M07_37,Tyber Zann: Here's one of the security outposts.  One moment.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_00,Thrawn: Tyber Zann.  I've come to collect your artifact for the emperor.  Comply with my demands, and I promise a swift and reasonably honorable death.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_01,Tyber Zann: Thrawn...  Of course, I knew you were still lurking in my shadows.  Don't tell me you're the contact Xizor arranged?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_02,Thrawn: In a manner of speaking, yes.  Xizor is dead.  The evidence you planted convinced Vader, but I recognized your unique signature.  You've overstepped your bounds for the last time, Zann.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_03,Tyber Zann: Really?  [Soft Laughing]  You don't think I came unprepared, do you?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_04,Thrawn: Well done, for a petty criminal.  Of course, I wouldn't have expected you to anticipate the hypervelocity gun on the surface...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_05,Tyber Zann: Well, I would expect an Imperial officer to be arrogant enough not to be ready for my surprises.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_06,Thrawn: Well.  This may actually prove interesting.  Why don't we begin?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_07,Tyber Zann: Agreed.  For an admittedly brilliant strategist, one thing you've never been, Thrawn, is boring.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_08,Zann Consortium Pilot: Bossk has stolen the artifact!  He's heading towards Thrawn's ship, all fire on the Hound's Tooth!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_09,Tyber Zann: No!  Let him go!  Let him go.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_10,Thrawn: I'm sure you are now aware, I have what I came for.  Goodbye, Tyber.  For the last time. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_11,Tyber Zann: The great Admiral Thrawn is running away from a fight?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_12,Thrawn: Unlike you, Tyber, I never considered retreating an act of cowardice.  It's an option, like any other.  In this case, my skills are needed elsewhere, and I've kept you busy long enough.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_13,Tyber Zann: Are you sure you're not just saving your skin?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_14,Thrawn: If I were you, I'd be more concerned about my own security, as you will soon discover.  Farewell...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_15,Zann Consortium Pilot: We're picking up alarm codes from our bases on multiple planets!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT02_M09_16,Tyber Zann: I want that Imperial fleet destroyed!  We have to find a way through!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_BOUNCE_CORUSCANT,Tyber Zann: A wanted fugitive from Kessel landing on an Imperial center?  I'm bold, but not stupid.  Perhaps another time...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_BOUNCE_ENDOR,Tyber Zann: The Empire has a massive fleet in orbit.  They must be protecting something.  Stay clear until the time is right.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_BOUNCE_SULLUST,Tyber Zann: The Rebellion is keeping a large fleet in orbit; they must be planning something.  I won't play my hand just yet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_01,Silri: While you sit on your throne looking smug, Bossk has taken the artifact and sold it to the Empire!  And you think a Dark Lord like Vader or the emperor won't know how to use its power!?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_02,Tyber Zann: Are you naïve enough to think I just let things happen that aren't according to my carefully laid plans? You've told me the artifact is useless, I shouldn't be concerned...should I?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_03,Silri: I...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_04,Tyber Zann: It's almost as if there was something about the artifact that you held back from me.  If I have now lost something to them of real value, through some lack of disclosure on your part, why...  I might take such a thing quite badly!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_05,Silri: Well...there might have been more...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_06,Tyber Zann: Shocking.  Tell me.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_07,Silri: I-- I can't be sure.  I believe that there may have been another key that was required.  A data lock such as that would be used only to hide something of great importance.  I thought it might be a lost Force technique, known only to the ancient Sith, but it would only be useful to me and my kind!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_08,Tyber Zann: But...you can't be sure.  Correct?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_09,Silri: I did not have time to find the answers.  I did not think you would give it away so carelessly!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_10,Tyber Zann: Silri, I want you to listen to me very carefully.  If you ever lie to me again, or hide information from me, you and every Dathomiri witch will die the day after you betray me!  And I'll kill everyone of those damned rancors as well!  Those orders already stand, and will be carried out whether I'm alive or not.  Do you understand me?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_11,Silri: I've heard enough!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_12,Tyber Zann: These are actions that you will set in motion.  Lie to me, betray me, withhold information from me again, and all of these things will come to pass!  Am I as clear as I can possibly be!?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_13,Silri: ...I understand.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_14,Tyber Zann: Splendid!  Now then, Urai?  You can begin tracking the locator beacon we placed on the artifact.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_15,Silri: What!?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_16,Tyber Zann: Did you really think I didn't know what would happen?  I let Bossk steal it!  I'm quite willing to sacrifice a million credits when it will lead me to the emperor's personal archives aboard the Eclipse.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_17,Silri: Why bother getting into the Eclipse at all?  You're so vastly powerful now, as you humbly stated a moment ago...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_18,Tyber Zann: I need to access to the emperor's private command console aboard the Eclipse to get what I really want.  The problem has always been finding the location of the archives that contain the passkey.  But, Bossk and Thrawn have helpfully solved that problem for me.  Do you have it, Urai?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_19,Urai Fen: I'm tracking it, Tyber.  It will take some time.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G17_20,Tyber Zann: I can wait...a bit longer.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_01,Urai Fen: Tyber, we are getting a message from Mandalore...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_02,Tyber Zann: From our pirates!?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_03,Urai Fen: Yes.  Their commander seems...excited.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_04,[UNUSED, DO NOT DISPLAY THIS LINE: TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_04] What goes here?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_05,Tyber Zann: Captain?  I trust you have good news?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_06,Zann Consortium Pirate Captain: I know the order was to leave Mandal Hypernautics alone, but some of my men couldn't resist of hitting some of their lesser shipyards outside the system.  I seized the opportunity to extort some more new ships from Mandal.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_07,Tyber Zann: Really.  And...how did they respond?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_08,Zann Consortium Pirate Captain: They were only too happy to pay a little more, we have some new toys for you!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_09,Tyber Zann: Well now, that is a prize!  An admirable job, captain.  Except, for one thing...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_10,Zann Consortium Pirate Captain: ...what's that?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G18_11,Tyber Zann: [Blaster Fire]  I cannot allow underlings to ignore my orders, or the Consortium simply degenerates into a pack of bandits!  Lets hope the man who replaces you will remember that...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_01,Iblis: You are a fool Zann!  Don't you see what's happening around you?  The Empire is building another Death Star!  No planet will be safe with that madman in power!  We can win though.  The Emperor and Vader are on board the new Death Star - with your help, we can destroy the battle station and the Empire in one blow!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_02,Tyber Zann: Rebellion, Empire, I don't care. I'm successful in what I do because I stay focused. If one Death Star was destroyed, the new one can be destroyed as well, but I'm not going to bother until it flies to me and tries to kill me and mine. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_03,Iblis: You don...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_04,Tyber Zann: I don't care.  It doesn't matter to me who is in charge.  Empires and Republics will come and go, but there will always be crime and powerful men like me. There will always be credits to steal, bribes to pay, and illegal needs to fulfill for a price.  And I will be the one who controls it all.  
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_05,Iblis: I was wrong.  Palpatine is mad and evil, but you are worse.  You're like a leech sucking on the lifeblood of the galaxy.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_06,Tyber Zann: Nonsense.  I am a simple business man.  I sell people what they want.  And everyone wants something.  Look at you - you want my help for your Rebellion.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_07,Iblis: I've changed my mind.  The New Republic could never be free owing you any kind of debt.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_08,Tyber Zann: But you are indebted to me - you owe me your life.  Now go.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_09,Urai Fen: Is it wise letting him go?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G19_10,Tyber Zann: No sense getting the Rebellion more angry than it already is.  If I killed him, he'd never hear about his wife Arrianya. Besides, he gave us something whether he knows it or not...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_01,Tyber Zann: Thanks to spies I have planted in the Rebellion, we know that both the emperor and Vader are in the Endor system.  That means Coruscant is wide open.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_02,Urai Fen: To Coruscant?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_03,Tyber Zann: That's where we've traced the artifact, isn't it?  By all indications, it's in the emperor's Imperial archive.  The Empire is sure to be caught off guard by such a bold raid on the Imperial archive itself.  That passkey is as good as ours!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_04,Urai Fen: Coruscant is going to be heavily guarded, even with the emperor and Vader absent.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_05,Tyber Zann: Thanks to IG-88's help on Bespin, we should be able to land without interference.  Get Silri, and prepare to raid the Imperial archive on Coruscant.  We must get in and out before the emperor returns from Endor.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_06,Urai Fen: Are you sure you want Silri along for this?  I...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_07,Tyber Zann: She is powerful and useful despite her...volatility.  Be ready, though; if she tries anything, I'll require your services.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G20_08,Urai Fen: I am ready.  I look forward to it if the opportunity arises.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G21_01,Silri: I sense a great disturbance in the Force!  The balance has shifted away from the dark side...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G21_02,Tyber Zann: That all sounds very nice, but what does it mean?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G21_03,Silri: The emperor, and Vader...  They're dead.  The Rebels must have destroyed them...!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G21_04,Urai Fen: The Rebels claim it to be true, they are broadcasting it all over the HoloNet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_G21_05,Tyber Zann: With the emperor dead, the Empire will be in chaos!  Most of the ships from the Kuat blockade will have returned from the battle over Endor to regroup.  The time to strike is now!  We must take control of the Eclipse!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_00,Silri: Tyber Zann is a fool if he thinks I will leave the artifact in the emperor's hands.  It will be mine!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_01,Silri: Dark Troopers.  Hmph.  Not so threatening when deactivated...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_02,Silri: I can feel the power of the artifact, it must be nearby!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_03,Silri: Which way?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_04,Silri: There it is...  Once I have all of its secrets, I will kill both of those fools who think to order me around!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_05,Silri: Something is wrong...  Darkness...  Great...strength in the Force...!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_06,Force Adept: I felt your presence the moment you landed, witch.  You should have stayed on Dathomir.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_07,Silri: I am safe on any world I choose, you pathetic weakling!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_08,Force Adept: I'll have your head, and that of your beast as trophies!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_09,Force Adept: Release that artifact, witch.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_10,Silri: Its secrets are mine, along with your life!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_11,Silri: It looks like we're trapped, we'll need to find a way out.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_12,Imperial Officer: I'd be killed if anyone knew I let you in here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_13,Tyber Zann: You're probably right.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_14,Force Adept: Well, well.  The great Tyber Zann.  I didn't expect to see you here...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_15,Tyber Zann: I doubt you expected to die, either.  But I'm full of surprises.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_16,Tyber Zann: That should take care of the cameras!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_17,Urai Fen: I can sense the dark side of the Force within you.  It has been a long time since I have had a challenging opponent.  Do not disappoint me.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_18,Urai Fen: There are three more of them.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_19,Urai Fen: The power is down.  Now I must reach Tyber.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_20,Tyber Zann: Now that the museum's defenses are down, we can bring in a little extra security, just as a precaution.  Good thing I left those MDUs parked out front.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_21,Tyber Zann: Damn!  A trap!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_22,Urai Fen: This door is being held shut by remote control.  There is nothing I can do to open it.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_23,Urai Fen: Got it!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_24,Tyber Zann: Just in time.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_25,Urai Fen: I just need a few minutes to find the passkey....
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_26,Tyber Zann: Hm.  A security system I didn't plan for.  You can bet the guards are on their way here as we speak.  We'll have to destroy them to release their control on the door.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_27,Urai Fen: Got it.  Do you want anything else in the vault?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_28,Tyber Zann: Tempting, but there's no time.  We have the plans and that's what we came for.  Let's leave while we still can!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_29,Silri: What is it, my pet?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_30,Tyber Zann: What's that thing doing out of its cage?  And why aren't you waiting in the hangar?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_31,Silri: I...  Sensed...  Something.  I went to investigate.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_32,Urai Fen: I will deal with you later.  This way, make haste!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_33,Force Adept: Halt, thieves!  Return what you've taken and I promise a quick and painless death!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_34,Tyber Zann: You must have no idea who I am...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_35,Force Adept: I know precisely who you are, and the reason you're here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_36,Silri: He's a teleporter!  This could prove interesting.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_37,Tyber Zann: What an amazing gift for understatement you have, do we have any MDUs left!?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_38,Tyber Zann: Was that really necessary?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_39,Urai Fen: Do you not know what this is?  It is a Juggernaut!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_40,Silri: Let's get out of here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_41,Tyber Zann: I'm not going to lie to anyone.  Breaking into the emperor's personal archive isn't going to be easy.  But we need that passkey.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_42,Tyber Zann: So let's review the plan: I'll infiltrate the security section and disable the monitoring controls.  That will blind the cameras while we're breaking into the vault.  After that...?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_43,Urai Fen: After that, it is up to me to sneak into the main power grid, and shut it down.  This will disable the turret guns.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_44,Tyber Zann: ...Silri?  Are you paying attention?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_45,Silri: ...and I wait, while you two get all the glory?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_46,Tyber Zann: You're guarding our only means of escape; don't forget it.  Once we have the plans, we'll need a transport to get past the exit defenses.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_47,Silri: I guess I didn't realize this mission was guard duty...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_48,Urai Fen: Give me the word at any time, Tyber.  I would be more than happy to eliminate her.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_49,Tyber Zann: I hate to admit it, Urai, but I...think she's actually growing on me.  Of course, it's comforting knowing that option is always available.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_50,Silri: There's something...troubling here...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_51,Tyber Zann: The vault is open!  Let's see what's inside...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_52,Tyber Zann: Why aren't those ysalamiri cages being deployed!?  We're in trouble here!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_53,Tyber Zann: Everyone, into the transport!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_54,Tyber Zann: This thing must move faster!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_55,Silri: Use the laser defenses!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M11_BOUNCE,Tyber Zann: Urai, Silri and myself are needed on Coruscant.  There's really no way we can break in without all three of us.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_00,Tyber Zann: That's the most magnificent thing I've ever seen, Urai!  Once we take control, we'll--
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_01,Urai Fen: Tyber, we are tracking several inbound fleets!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_02,Tyber Zann: It's probably the remains of the Imperial fleet attempting to repair and regroup here.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_03,Urai Fen: There are multiple Alliance signatures as well...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_04,Tyber Zann:  Already? More organized than I thought. Quickly, then! 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_05,Han Solo: Unidentified ships: what is your purpose in this sector?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_06,Tyber Zann: We heard of the Alliance's glorious victory at Endor, and have come to join!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_07,Han Solo: Listen, Zann: if you're on the level, help us destroy that Super Star Destroyer.  You'll be well rewarded.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_08,Tyber Zann: Looks like there are a few space stations between ourselves and the Eclipse.  Take them out!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_09,Han Solo: Alright, Zann, don't think I'm not paying attention.  If I smell a double-cross, I won't waste any time taking you out.  Oh, and uh, good luck.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_10,Pilot: We've finished scanning the Eclipse Star Destroyer - the main weapon looks to be functional.  If we could board that thing and get our hands on that superlaser...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_11,Tyber Zann: I'm way ahead of you.  Just worry about those defenses.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_12,Pilot: Imperial ships dropping out of hyperspace.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_13,Pilot: More Rebel ships incoming.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_14,Pilot: We've got a massive Imperial fleet heading right for us!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_15,Pilot: Direct Hit! Yeah!!!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_16,Pilot: Whoa!  Look at that!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_17,Tyber Zann: Just like shooting Takaam Pods in a Dalass Pit.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_18,Tyber Zann: You didn't need that, did you?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_19,Zann Consortium Pilot: What the...!?  Super Star Destroyer incoming, sir!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_20,Tyber Zann: I bet that cost a fortune.  Oh well.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_21,Tyber Zann: If the Emperor weren't dead, that would have made him quite upset.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_22,Tyber Zann: You fools never learn, do you?
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_23,Pilot: We've taken control of the Eclipse superlaser!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_24,Tyber Zann: Excellent!  Let's go hunting!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_25,Pilot: We're approaching the space station now, initiating boarding protocols.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_26,Pilot: We've sabotaged the space station's main reactor!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_27,Pilot: We've got it! The space station is ours!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_28,Zann Consortium Pilot: We're approaching the Eclipse now.  Initiating boarding protocols...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_29,Zann Consortium Pilot: We've taken control of the Eclipse!  There isn't much functional equipment, but the superlaser is operational!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_30,Han Solo: Ok, Zann, fun's over.  You wanted to capture the emperor's new toy?  Fine.  Let's see how long you can keep her...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_31,Tyber Zann: Hah!  The Rebels have served their purpose.  Destroy them.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_32,Zann Consortium Pilot: Sir, the Eclipse is under attack!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_33,Tyber Zann: We've lost the Eclipse...!  All units withdraw!  Repeat: all units withdraw!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_34,Zann Consortium Pilot: The Eclipse's superlaser has malfunctioned!  We'll need time to make repairs!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_35,Zann Consortium Pilot: The Eclipse's superlaser is back online and ready to fire!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_BOUNCE,Tyber Zann: The moment of my ultimate triumph cannot be executed with me!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_ACT03_M12_BOUNCE_GEN,Tyber Zann: Kuat is too hot right now.  I need to formulate a plan before I can tackle this planet, and infiltrate the Eclipse.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_01,Urai Fen: Governor Koong Eeth has proven difficult.  We aren't going to kill him, when simply maiming him should accomplish our goals.  Getting past his impressive security force, and severely injuring him sends the appropriate message.  No one denies the Zann Consortium.  No one.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_02,Urai Fen: Well done!  Fear is one of our most powerful weapons.  Word has spread on what we did to the governor.  In a matter of weeks, everyone on Saleucami will do what we tell them.  Empire and Rebellion forces will no longer have use of special abilities on this planet.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_03,Defiler: Our reputation of intimidation has allowed us to successfully set up our racketeering efforts on Felucia.  While the planet seems primitive with its fungi forests, there is much wealth to be gathered.  The inhabitants are starved for entertainment of any kind and our organization can provide many services to relieve them of their funds.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_04,IG-88: I am tasked to enter the Kessel system, and locate an Imperial communications satellite.  With that unit in our control, enemy fleet movement will be revealed.  We will be able to direct Imperial fleet traffic in order to steal ships and create havoc in enemy supply lines.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_05,IG-88: We have succeeded beyond my calculations.  We have added a new ship to our fleet.  We are redirecting enemy credits into our own coffers.  Already, we have heard reports of transport ships mysteriously disappearing as a result of our taking over control of the communication satellite.  The strategy appears to be working, and should proceed as planned.
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_06,Defiler: I've successfully established a recruitment center on Kashyyyk.  We are limiting Wookie food supplies and they've responded well to the conditioning with only around 300 unable to complete the regiment. The planet is successfully corrupted and these units are at your disposal. Long live the Consortium!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_07,Defiler: The vast Kuat ship yards are in your control. I've set up a black market ring to bring the technologies of your enemies into your hands. The Zann Consortium will now be able to use our stolen plans to build units in the future. There was some resistance from a few of the powerful families controlling Kuat, but there's no longer a power base to stop us there at the present time. Long live the Consortium!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_08,Urai Fen: Our forces mass to move on the planet. We will not fail the Zann Consortium. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_09,Tyber Zann: Well done, this world has been successfully corrupted. 
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_CLD_10,IG-88: I've computed a 98% chance of success.  Begin the battle!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_END_CINEMATIC_00,Tyber Zann: Do you see, Urai!?  Billions of credits!  Technical data hoarded for decades!  Priceless works of art!  It's incredible!  There is more wealth in these hidden vaults than even I can imagine!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_END_CINEMATIC_01,Urai Fen: An impressive victory.  With the contents of the vault and this ship, there may soon be a new Galactic Emperor!
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_END_CINEMATIC_02,Tyber Zann: I've no need to keep the half-constructed Eclipse.  And it presents a target even the Rebels couldn't miss!  With the treasures from Palpatine's vaults, I can now spread my organization across the galaxy.  Let the Rebels form their New Republic!  I've always wanted to own a senator...
TEXT_SPEECH_UW_END_CINEMATIC_03,Silri: Soon, you will understand the true meaning of power, Tyber Zann, when I teach it to you!

TEXT_SPEECH_WAYLAND_BLK_VICTORY_COR50_02,Defiler: There are Empire and Rebel technology secrets to be had here, and we're starting to collect them now...
TEXT_SPEECH_WAYLAND_RKT_VICTORY_COR50_01,Defiler: We are successfully luring enemy forces here and taking advantage of their salvage after our forces destroy them in space.
TEXT_SPEECH_YAVIN_BRB_VICTORY_COR51_02,Defiler: Although Tyber Zann feels the Rebels are insignificant, bribing some of their leaders may prove useful.
TEXT_SPEECH_YAVIN_RKT_VICTORY_COR51_01,Defiler: Our organization is set up on Yavin 4.  Our corruption efforts bring us credits and hopefully more knowledge of the sector.

TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_EIGHT_43,Hint: You can avoid patrols by hiding in nebulas.  If you set off the alarm, the patrols will eventually stop hunting the Falcon.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_00,Borrowed Time
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_01,With the cargo container holding the EMP device delivered to the station, now is the time to launch our raid and secure data on this Imperial superweapon.  Once the fleet nears the system, the EMP will be detonated, granting us the most time possible to get to the station and search for information.  Several raiding parties are ready to board the station - we just have to make sure no other Imperials show up!
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_02,Task: Build a fleet. Escort the Sundered Heart to Corulag and protect the shuttles while the soldiers search for information.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_08,Protect the troop transports until the search is complete.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_29,At least one shuttle must make it to the exit point.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_42,Notice: Captain Antilles has taken command of Princess Leia's ship, the Tantive IV.  The Sundered Heart and the Droids are no longer available for use.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_43,At least one shuttle must survive the mission.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_NINE_44,The Sundered Heart must survive the mission.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_00,Highest Bidder
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_01,In contacting some of the underworld's more questionable sources of information, Mon Mothma has inadvertently put the Alliance at risk.  A pirate associate of one of the contacts has obtained data on the locations of Alliance sympathizers and facilities.  If this data were to fall into the hands of the Empire, the Alliance would be in great jeopardy!  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_02,The pirate has set up a meeting with the Empire in neutral territory near Atzerri, hoping to cash in on this sensitive data.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_03,Task: Build a fleet. Escort  Captain Antilles to Atzerri and recover the data.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_10,Disable the pirate's frigate by damaging it.

TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_47,The Sundered Heart must survive the battle.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_00,Rescue the Millennium Falcon
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_01,No sooner does the Alliance need the assistance of a smuggler than one they've had past dealings with volunteers - albeit unintentionally.  Han Solo seems to have run afoul of the Empire yet again.  This time, he's caught in a tractor beam of an Imperial Star Destroyer, more than likely looking for illegitimate cargo that he's carrying.  In return for saving his neck, the Alliance will certainly be able to persuade him to assist in future operations.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_02,Task: Take a fleet to Corellia and rescue Han Solo.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_SEVEN_A_06,Disable the tractor beam holding the Millennium Falcon

TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_00,Handle with Care!  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_01,Mon Mothma has sent out the call for Han Solo and Chewbacca, asking them to perform a service in return for a surprisingly large fee.  What the task is, only Mon Mothma can say.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_02,Task: Move the Millennium Falcon to Mon Mothma's location.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_23,Get Han and Chewie to the storage area and recover the schematics
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_28,Hint: Use Chewbacca's Steal Vehicle ability to capture enemy units.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_30,Hint: Enemies won't know the unit is stolen unless you attack.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_33,Hint: Use Han's EMP Burst to disable any units and turrets near Han.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_37,Hint: Chewbacca can use his Bail Out ability to leave any vehicle he has captured.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_48,Han Solo and Chewbacca must survive the mission
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT03_MISSION_TEN_49,Destroy the power source for the turbolaser towers
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_00,The Defense of Mon Calamari
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_01,Mon Calamari are a fierce and passionate people.  Their spirit rekindled by the return of their enslaved people and the reclamation of their technology, they have revolted against the Imperials that subjugated them.  Staging revolts all over the planet, the Imperials stationed on Mon Calamari were easily overcome.  Rapidly taking the battle into space, they made use of any ships they could to attack the Empire vessels stationed above them.  Finally liberated, they have quickly set about rebuilding their fleet and preparing for all-out war against the Empire.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_02,Wasting no time, the Empire sets a plan in motion to retake Mon Calamari and prevent its people from becoming a threat to Imperial domination.  A massive fleet has been organized, and will soon leave from Imperial controlled space.  Their mission: retake the rebellious planet Mon Calamari.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_03,Task: Defeat the Imperial fleet before it can reach Mon Calamari.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_07,REWARD SYSTEM CUT
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_19,Task: Remove the Empire fleet from Mon Calamari.  Cruisers will not be available for construction until control is restored.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_22,Hint: Mon Calamari can only be approached by three routes - guard them accordingly
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_ELEVEN_25,Task: Remove the Empire fleet from Mon Calamari.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TEN_100,Hint: Target the Tantive IV's engines to disable the ship.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_00,The Final Battle
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_01,The Empire's ultimate weapon, The Death Star, has been unleashed upon an unsuspecting galaxy.  The planet Alderaan was the first to pay the price, with millions of deaths being the cost.  The Rebel fleet is far too weak to confront the battle station head on, but with the aid of General Dodonna's military knowledge and courageous fighter pilots, the Rebellion may yet have a chance.  
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_02,Task: Confront the Death Star in a tactical battle that includes Red Squadron.  If Red Squadron survives the battle, Luke can destroy the Death Star and win the game
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_21,Notice: The Droids have returned to Rebel control.  Red Squadron is now available for use.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_23,Task: Do not allow Mon Mothma to be destroyed by the Death Star - her presence is vital to the Alliance, and the game will be lost if she is destroyed.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_ACT04_MISSION_TWELVE_24,Hint: The Death Star can only be destroyed by Red Squadron.  Facing it without them will allow you to destroy the accompanying fleet, but the Death Star itself is immune to all other attackers.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_INVALID_ACTION,Mon Mothma: This action seems inappropriate for the situation.
TEXT_STORY_REBEL_TECH_ADVANCE,Notice: New technology is now available by using the droids' steal ability
TEXT_STORY_STANDARD_ACT02_NOTICE,Notice: Planets which are not revealed yet will be later.  It is recommended you conquer enemy planets and secure the galaxy before advancing to the next mission.

TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_02,You expect congratulations?  The attempted Rebellion assault was beneath pathetic and your response, while satisfactory, was hardly impressive.   
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CONTRIVED_ATTACK_03,You have failed to heed my warning and your resulting defeat brings disgrace to both of us in the eyes of the Emperor.  I will not tolerate more losses.  The Rebellion fleet must be wiped out.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CREDIT_WINDFALL_00,I have discovered some unspent credits in the Imperial coffers.  See to it that these credits are spent wisely.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CREDITS_00,Your handling of Imperial funds is admirable.  Unfortunately, we need to hold a larger surplus in reserve if we are to succeed over the long term.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_CREDITS_01,Your actions have been satisfactory.  Our scientists have put together a few new weapons that I need tested.  I will require a full report of course.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_DEFECTION_01,We strive to remove all traces of treachery and rebellion from our galaxy.  One of our lieutenants has been caught selling supplies to the Black Sun Pirates.  Since being discovered, he has allowed the pirates to take control of the planet.  You are to regain control of this planet and dispose of the deserter.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_DEFECTION_02,Your tactics are commendable.  In compensation for completing this task you will be given the use of an AT-AT for your upcoming battles.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_DEFECTION_TITLE,Pirate Defection
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FAVOR_01,Despite your incompetence, Lord Vader has requested your assistance in a personal errand.  He wants you accompany him to a Rebellion planet to recover some captured Imperial forces.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FAVOR_TITLE,A Favor for Lord Vader
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_00,You have interfered with the Empire for the last time.  Too many have failed in bringing about your termination.  I will be seeing to your destruction personally.  Surrender is no longer an option.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_01,Do not presume that I have been defeated, commander.  When the time is right, I will strike again.  The next time we meet, things will not end as fortunately for you as they have today.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_02,My fleet has failed me.  They were weak and deserved the punishment they received.  Rest easy today, commander, for tomorrow I will return to exact my vengeance.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_FLEET_RAMPAGE_03,Yet again you have failed the Empire.  You have allowed a Rebellion fleet to defeat you on your own territory.  If you do not regroup and exterminate these criminals, you will learn how Lord Vader deals with incompetence.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_00,I have word from Lord Vader of a Rebel gathering.  Apparently, he has sensed that many of the Rebellion's leaders are gathered together on one planet.  This is our chance to crush the Rebellion.  Take a fleet and assassinate these dissenters.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_01,You have let another opportunity passed you by.  The Rebellion has learned of our attack and dispersed its leaders.  Lord Vader will not be pleased with your incompetence.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_HERO_GATHERING_02,We have succeeded in disrupting the leadership of the Rebellion.  Lord Vader is very pleased with our actions.  Unfortunately, your ineptitude has allowed our targets to escape death.  Fortunately, they will need time to recover from the battle.  During this time, they will be unable to command any of the Rebellion forces.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_HUNT_CAPITAL_SHIPS_00,Our probes are reporting that several Rebel capital ships have been spotted in orbit above a Rebel-controlled planet.  We cannot allow the Rebellion to grow unchallenged.  I need you to seek this fleet out and dispatch at least 3 of these ships.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_HUNT_CAPITAL_SHIPS_01,You have performed satisfactorily today, commander.  See to it that you do not let the Rebellion acquire such a great force again.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_PLANET_OWNERSHIP_FLIP_00,Rebel dissenters have turned one of your planets against us, commander.  Again you have failed your duties to the Empire.  Your position may soon be replaced if you cannot maintain civility on your own planets.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_PLANET_WINDFALL_00,We have been in contact with one of the Rebellion's systems.  They have come around to our way of thinking and have sworn allegiance to the Empire.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_REVOLT_01,Rebel cells are showing their faces across the galaxy.  Troublemakers on one of our systems have stirred up Rebel sentiment.  They have managed to overthrow the local forces and sworn allegiance to this Rebellion.  You will receive special compensation for quelling this uprising.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_REVOLT_02,Excellent.  It seems you have a bit of a following amongst the troops.  Several units have requested reassignment to your command.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_REVOLT_TITLE,Rebel Revolt
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SABOTAGE_01,We need to send an emissary to help convince others of their wrongdoing.  Your tactics leave room for improvement.  It is always best to weaken the enemy prior to battle.  Boba Fett specializes in the neutralization of Rebellion officers.  The removal of a Rebellion officer can turn a difficult battle into a simple one.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SABOTAGE_02,You have weakened the Rebels and made way for an Imperial invasion.  Try not to forget this lesson.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SABOTAGE_TITLE,Rebel Sabotage

TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SCOUT_02,Your information has proven to be most useful to the Empire.  We have come to the determination that your forces are inadequate.  Take these credits and strengthen your command.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SMUGGLER_01,Bounty hunters have tracked down Han Solo.  The traitorous smuggler is apparently in the company of the Rebellion.  This scoundrel has stolen countless credits and supplies from the Empire.  He must be punished for his crimes.  Destroy him and any Rebellion accomplices.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SMUGGLER_02,Your actions have been successful.  You have managed to cleanse the Rebel presence from this planet, however, word comes to us that Han Solo managed to survive.  You are treading on thin ice, commander.  Due to your incompetence, I will finish the job and take the planet surface.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_SMUGGLER_TITLE,Rebel Smuggler
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_STRUCTURE_00,A base alone cannot protect worlds from the traitorous Rebellion.  Fleets, ground troops and secondary structures all play a part in defense.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_STRUCTURE_01,I am sure the Emperor would thank you if he was present.  I believe you will find these new troops useful.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TECH_WINDFALL_00,Your service to the Empire is noted.  While you continue your extermination of the Rebels, I'd like you to field test this new tech.  Your tech level has been raised.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAITOR_01,We have discovered a traitor in our midst.  He was discovered funneling classified information to the Rebellion.  Incompetence has allowed him to escape to Rebel territory.  Destroy all Rebellion resistance on the Rebellion planet harboring him.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAITOR_02,The traitor has been found and justice is being administered.  Let this be a lesson as to what happens to those who turn their backs on the Empire.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAITOR_TITLE,Imperial Traitor
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAP_00,Once again the Rebellion shows its laughable grasp of military strategy.  They have left one of their traitorous worlds poorly defended and I am assigning you to make them pay for this error.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAP_01,Your lack of urgency has allowed the Rebel scum to recognize their weakness and construct a defense!  Were my orders somehow unclear?  I will be personally informing the Emperor of your incompetence.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_TRAP_02,It's a trap!  Bolster your defenses to survive the battle.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UNIT_WINDFALL_00,Your actions have been adequately successful.  Our scientists have put together a few new weapons that I need tested.  I will require a full report of course.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UNITS_00,Credits sitting unspent do not work for the Empire; only the armies that money can produce are useful.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UNITS_01,You have saved me time and resources.  It is only fair that I allow you to share in the surplus funding.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_00,Our space stations and ground bases are the backbone of the galaxy's defenses.  We need to increase our strength if we are to teach the Rebellion that their cause is a losing proposition.  Upgrade a starbase to strengthen our defenses.
TEXT_TAR_EVENT_UPGRADE_STATION_01,You handled that well.  I am directing some of the Imperial funds recovered from the Rebellion to your accounts.  Use them well.

TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_05,TASK: Build a Defiler. 
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_08,TASK: Drag your new Defiler unit to Honoghr and drop him in the 'SPREAD CORRUPTION' context-sensitive slot.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_10,The Zann Consortium gains numerous benefits from corruption. While taking control of planets is necessary for production, only corruption is necessary to gain credits.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_11,On the galactic level, corruption produces a steady stream of income for each planet corrupted.  In addition, it creates an artificial trade route between all corrupted planets, and allows Zann Consortium fleets to travel through enemy worlds using bribery.  Corruption also acts as a limited spy network - you can view certain details of enemy planets and their contents.  Corruption has a detrimental effect on the Empire's production time and the Alliance's production costs.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_12,In tactical combat, corruption gives the Zann Consortium a cash bounty for every Imperial and Rebel unit destroyed in battle.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_13,Your enemies also gain certain benefits from your corruption: smugglers on corrupted worlds do not disappear over time; bounty hunters gain discounts to their hero removal and units produced at Cantinas and Hutt Palaces cost less.  Also, you cannot produce units on worlds you do not actually control, and controlling worlds do not give as large a financial gain as just corrupting them.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_14,Certain enemy heroes prevent corruption from taking hold, and many enemy heroes can remove corruption given time.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G01_15,Honoghr is now under the corrupting influence of Tyber Zann.  Note that you can now see more information about the planet, and your daily income has increased.  Corrupt other worlds to make even more of a profit, but beware - both enemy factions can see your corruption.

TEXT_UW_ACT01_G02_11,TASK: Deploy Urai Fen on Shola.  Taken control of the planet and recover the Sith Artifact.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G02_12,Striking Back at Jabba
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G02_13,Jabba thought that he could absorb all my planets and take control of the Consortium.  Shola was one of my storage houses for contraband, and Jabba wasted no time in stealing everything I had there.  Unfortunately, Urai chose Shola as the hiding place for the Sith Artifact I stole - we need to get it back and destroy Jabba's forces there before they manage to uncover it.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G03_08,TASK: Take a fleet including Tyber Zann to Yavin 4.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G03_09,HINT: Remember that you can corrupt planets in a chain and bribe planets to let you pass without battle.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_01,TASK: Use a Defiler to establish a black market on Kuat.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_02,TASK: Drag Tyber Zann to the 'BUY' context-sensitive slot on Kuat.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_04,TASK: Purchase 'Disruptor Technology.'
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_05,HINT: After accessing the Black Market your hero is removed from the game temporarily.  The amount of time they remain out of play depends on the hero.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_06,The Zann Consortium advances their technology differently than the other factions.  While all of their units are generally available from the beginning, the special abilities must be purchased from the black market.  In this way the units become more powerful as the game advances.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_07,To enter the Black Market, you must first spread corruption on a system.  Once corrupted, you can drag Tyber Zann or Urai Fen, and some other heroes to the Black Market context sensitive slot.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_08,Different heroes have different effects on the Black Market.  Tyber Zann lowers the tech level requirement of technology one level, while Urai Fen can gain tech more quickly.  Of course, these abilities have a large effect on the price you pay.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_09,Tyber Zann has accessed the black market.  Since Kuat belongs to the Empire, you will only see technology that they control.  Rebel-controlled planets will have different technology available.  Note that some of the advances are relatively cheap, while others are extremely expensive.  Each ability has an associated enemy tech level - the Zann Consortium has no tech level of its own.  Because of this, the Zann Consortium must balance its expansion with the need for new tech.  Once the Empire's tech level advances, the price of the tech associated with that level is cut dramatically.
TEXT_UW_ACT01_G05_10,HINT: Note that you can hover the mouse over each tech advancement to see what it does and which of the Zann Consortium units will be affected by it.
