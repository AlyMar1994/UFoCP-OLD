Fixes are marked with an asterisk (*), followed by the "original" text and after the "fixed" text (marked with "O" and "F"). If an explanation is required (or extra info included), it's expanded upon with a double-asterisk (**).

THESE EDITS FOLLOW THE STANDARDS OF AMERICAN ENGLISH! Odd spacing is not changed in these edits, as that was intended (unless it is extremely jarring, like sex-tupple spacing in the middle of a paragraph). The double-space seperating "Our Defiler" and the triple-space at the end of the corruption dialogs stay.

Last of note, I am a human being and I make mistakes. Please point out text errors in-game through bug reporting!

For any corruption mission briefings that are edited, their tooltips for the menus are also edited! They're not mentioned, though.
