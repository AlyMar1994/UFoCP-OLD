==> Description
================
A comprehensive bug-fixing mod for Petroglyph's "STAR WARS: Empire at War – Forces of Corruption" ("FoC") expansion. The goal of the Unofficial Forces of Corruption Patch (also "UFoCP") is to correct as many errors that Petroglyph ignored within FoC as possible, to whatever limit is available within the Alamo engine and community-developed tools, in one package.
