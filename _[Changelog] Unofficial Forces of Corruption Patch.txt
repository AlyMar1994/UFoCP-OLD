==================
*Fixed STAR WARS credits music.
**Base-game "Credits_Ep3.MP3" was an incorrect version of "The Throne Room/End Title" from one of STAR WARS (: Episode IV - A New Hope)'s soundtrack releases. I've replaced it with the correct normal-speed render (which I've had ripped from the movie itself).
